So what we can do is we can go to Google and check how much, I don't remember what was the exact price for that invoice for YLABS. So you can take whatever price is there and create or update an invoice. And in this invoice you can just go to Google and then type whatever money in Euro and then convert it to USD and then take whatever sum was there and update the invoice to include USD and on this invoice use the IBAN from Revolut. Yes, so I'm not sure which IBAN they have. Maybe it's not the right one because I used to have a, I still have a private Revolut account and previously they used it for paying us. So this time we need to use Revolut from the company and maybe this is what they used last time. But you can just include this on the invoice and then send them an updated version to them. So the new updated invoice should have a USD sum there converted from Euros and then the Revolut IBAN there.",Invoice Update for YLABS,"Maria from YLABS has inquired about the USD account, indicating that they likely want to make a payment in American dollars. To address this, we can start by checking the amount for the invoice related to YLABS.

Once we determine the exact amount, we can convert the figure from Euros to USD. To do this, we can simply use Google to find the current exchange rate. After obtaining the USD amount, we need to update the invoice accordingly.

It’s important to ensure that the invoice includes the correct IBAN from our company Revolut account. Previously, I used my private Revolut account for payments, but this time we need to use the company account. I'm not sure if they have the correct IBAN from the corporate account, so we should verify this.

Finally, we will send them the updated invoice that includes the converted USD amount and the correct Revolut IBAN."

So potentially, we can send the link to our channel right now or five minutes before the event we start the stream, usually it's five to ten minutes before the event, then we can send the link.

Moving forward, we should always verify the domain name of the email sender. For example, if we see an email from sahar@iguazio.com, we need to ensure that the subject line aligns with the domain name before we send any communication.

Additionally, I propose that we start preparing a process document for reaching out to sponsors. This document can include some templates to streamline our communication. I believe it's essential to outline this step.

So for example, for sponsors, right? We know that maybe you can do it every Monday or I don't know, however you feel like, but like at least one per week, we need to check if there are any missing Trello cards. Like for example, we know that in three weeks, we will have an email, sponsored email, and we don't have a Trello card for that, create that, right? So then we make sure we don't forget that.

But still, like my idea is that you open every day the Trello board and go through each card and see is there anything I need to do for that card today, right? And this way, we'll make sure that we don't forget to like send these emails and do other things like for sponsored workshops. This is very important to send a report or for newsletters also, it's very important to send reports, right? So we don't want to forget about these things. So we need to do them according to our processes. So for that, please go through all the Trello cards and make sure we don't forget to do anything.

Like, I don't know, it would be nice to know like what kind of things we have in each of the trailer cards and then having a list of to-dos from these trailer cards for today.

For example, regarding sponsors, you might choose to do this every Monday or at a frequency that works for you. However, we should aim to check at least once a week. If we know, for instance, that we have a sponsored email scheduled in three weeks but lack a corresponding Trello card, please create that card to ensure we don’t forget.

Additionally, each day, please review the Trello board and go through the cards to see if there's anything that requires action today. I understand that this might not be the most efficient method, as it requires clicking on each card to see its contents. However, over time, you'll become familiar with which cards need your attention without having to review every detail every day.

It's crucial that we keep track of tasks related to sponsored emails, workshops, and newsletters, including sending necessary reports. By following our established processes, we can ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.

While this method may seem a bit cumbersome, I encourage you to think about more effective alternatives. For instance, it would be beneficial to have a list of actionable items derived from the Trello cards for each day. If there's a way to streamline this process, please explore it. For now, though, let's stick with the daily review to maintain our workflow."

The second process document should cover the steps for the subsequent reminder. Start by checking for any missing newsletters. This involves reviewing the schedule for any new items. After that, update the trailer board accordingly.

After watching a video, I find it helpful to take notes on a piece of paper. This helps me capture what I need to remember or any action items that arise from the video.

After taking notes, I make it a point to revisit them. This practice ensures that I don’t forget important details or questions I might have, which can easily slip my mind if I’m not careful. For example, instead of creating a process document, you might consider simply providing context and linking the longer video content.

I often find that in one video, I can think of three to five different questions or action items. It’s easy to overlook one or two of them without a clear system in place. By following this note-taking method, you can reduce the chances of forgetting what needs to be done.

Usually, we expect the price to be lower. The recent figure pertains to the tax declaration for the last year, specifically for 2023. 

I believe I previously suggested that we should rename this entry, although I’m not certain if I actually communicated that or just thought about it. Additionally, it seems we have two records with the same amount, which may not be accurate. 

As a reminder, we have a monthly payment that occurs at the beginning of each month. However, this particular entry is irregular rather than exceptional. I think you might have handled this independently. I recall sending you an email regarding the payment, and rather than completing the payment as instructed, it seems you entered it into the spreadsheet instead.

When you receive a voice message or any message, consider whether it’s something you need to address immediately or if it can wait. Make a note of it to ensure you don’t forget to follow up later. 

It’s also important to listen to my voice notes right away, as they may contain critical information you need at that moment. Evaluate each note to determine its urgency and relevance, and take appropriate actions. This is just a recommendation to help you feel less overwhelmed. The same goes for Loom videos; some will contain information that is necessary for immediate tasks, while others can be postponed.

Regarding the invoice for Open Source Spotlight, I believe I’ve already shared the next steps you need to take. This task can wait until next week, as it's not urgent. On the other hand, the newsletter promotion I mentioned can be started now. If any part of this process isn’t clear, please don’t hesitate to ask for clarification.

For items like the deals in the CRM, those can also wait. In the meantime, focus on completing the onboarding document and transferring the process documents to the shared drive. 

Keep in mind that sometimes more pressing matters will arise, and I will clearly indicate which tasks should be prioritized. I understand that I may continue to present you with new tasks, and this could lead to a growing to-do list.

So at a specific time we go live, we stream it to YouTube, and then at the same time I record the podcast locally. And then we send it to Dave for editing. Usually it happens automatically, we just upload the mp3 files to Dropbox, and then Dave sees them, and they edit this, and they send us an edited version. Typically Dave writes us when it's ready, but also there is an automated email, automatic email that we get, and it's also added to the to-do list, I think. So then once we have that, we put this to Spotify for podcasters, so we schedule it for a specific time. Usually it's Friday, I don't remember, I think 7 p.m. Berlin time, something like that. I hope it's all in the process documents, you'll probably find all of that. And then we schedule it, and then on Friday it's released as a podcast episode, so yeah, we have it. And then once we have it on Spotify for podcasters, it automatically publishes it on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iTunes I think, and some other platforms. So then we need to get the links from these platforms, and then put them in a specific form, and then this way we create a page. And this page needs to be included in the newsletter, right? So the thing you would need to do between Friday evening and Monday morning is this, what I just said, publishing a page. So typically you just need to get the links from Spotify and Apple Podcasts, put them in a form, and YouTube, put them in a form, and then execute one thing on GitHub, there is of course a process document for that, and that's pretty much it. So it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes of your time. But also what I just described, I think it's in the templates, in Trello templates, so the entire process. As you get into this with time, I think you'll understand. So I hope it gives enough context for now.",Podcast Production Process,"The podcast production begins with scheduling a time to go live with the speaker. At the agreed time, we stream the session on YouTube while simultaneously recording it locally. After the recording, we upload the MP3 files to Dropbox for editing by Dave.

Typically, Dave handles the editing automatically and informs us via a message when the edited version is ready. There’s also an automated email notification, and the task is added to our to-do list. Once we receive the edited podcast, we upload it to Spotify for Podcasters and schedule its release, usually for Fridays around 7 p.m. Berlin time. This process is detailed in our documentation.

Once the episode is published on Spotify for Podcasters, it automatically appears on other platforms, including Apple Podcasts and iTunes. We then collect the links from these platforms to create a dedicated page. This page is essential for inclusion in our newsletter.

From Friday evening to Monday morning, your main task will be to publish this page. This includes gathering links from Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube, placing them in the appropriate form, and executing one action on GitHub. A process document is available for this task, and I estimate it should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete. The entire process is also outlined in Trello templates. As you get familiar with it over time, it will become clearer. I hope this explanation provides the necessary context for now."

So for the podcast, we schedule it live, yes, and then we do it on YouTube. At the same time, I record it locally. So locally, there is an mp3 file that I upload to Dropbox. When we do that, Dave, our podcast editor, should automatically see it. If he does not, I think typically we also let him know that there is a new podcast episode. I don't think it's necessary because he gets an invite. He gets a notification about that. So I don't think you need to reach out to him. So there is a process. He will just let you know that, yeah, it's done. But also, there is a special notification email. I recently forwarded you that email. So you will be receiving those emails when Dave uploads something to the Dropbox folder. We will receive a notification, you, me, and it also goes to the to-do list. Then you take the mp3 file, the edited file, and upload to Spotify for Podcasters. Yes, and it distributes it to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, whatever automatically.

So that's why you need to get these links and fill in the form. You perform the GitHub task, create a page. But yeah basically that's it. Also talk to Valeria because she might have an idea how exactly you can pre-fill it in the best possible way. And then of course once you agree on the way it should be done we should document everything. So now you're getting familiar with the process documents but soon I think you'll know your way around them more or less. And then this is when you should probably keep track of things you now learned somewhere. Included maybe also in the onboarding document.

Once Dave completes the editing, he will let us know. Additionally, I recently forwarded you a special notification email that alerts us when Dave uploads something to the Dropbox folder. This notification goes to both you and me, and it also populates our to-do list. 

After that, you will take the edited MP3 file and upload it to Spotify for Podcasters. This platform will then distribute the episode to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and others automatically. Keep in mind that you won’t have access to the links until the episode goes live, which occurs at 5 or 7 p.m. Berlin time on Friday.

Once it is published, you will receive the links to Spotify and Apple Podcasts. At that point, it’s crucial to fill out the corresponding form and perform the GitHub task to create a page for the episode. 

I recommend discussing the pre-filling process with Valeria, as she might have insights to make it more efficient. After you agree on the best approach, we should document everything thoroughly. As you familiarize yourself with the process documents, it may be beneficial to keep notes on what you’ve learned for future reference, including potential updates to the onboarding document.

I aim to apply this to all our process documents so that they are fully comprehensive, making it easy to follow without much thought when using them as templates.

Another area for improvement is the focus of our process documents. Currently, they primarily emphasize how to perform tasks, but we need to also address why and when certain actions should be taken. For instance, we must clarify why our community members need access to Slack data for analytics purposes. That is the rationale behind our monthly data dumps, which provide them with fresh data.

Furthermore, it is crucial to specify when these tasks should be performed, such as completing the data dumps every month when reminders are sent out. I want to ensure that each document provides context, helping users understand why the document exists, why the process is necessary, and not just how to execute it.

To enhance clarity, we should refer to the calendar as the ""DataTax Club Events Calendar."" This title specifies the purpose and content of the calendar more clearly, as the term ""calendar"" can be ambiguous.

Regarding the Eventbrite process documents, it's best to leave them untouched when transitioning to the new shared drive. We should disregard anything related to Eventbrite and allow those documents to remain in the old Google folder."

We can try to use chatGPT for creating a bio based on their LinkedIn profile, for example. Right now, we just take whatever they already wrote in LinkedIn if they don't respond.

But I think what we can do is try to ask Johanna to also do that when she comes up with questions. So typically the process is like that. So first we try to find a guest, agree on the time and once we have a yes from them that they do want to participate regardless of whether we agreed on time or not, we share, we create a podcast document and add Johanna to conversation saying hey Johanna here is a process document or here is a podcast document. And she starts working on that. Lately there was a problem that we have delays with that so we delay this document until it's quite late. So I want to fix that and once we have, once we agreed on having a guest ping Johanna immediately and ask to maybe we can ask her when she can complete it. So then the idea is we want to announce an event as early as possible so more people can sign up and if we delay it till the very late then few people sign up and join the event. So maybe in one of the emails, the first ones that you write to Johanna once we agree with somebody's hey Johanna there is a new process document can you please let us know when you can work on it. We want to publish it as soon as possible so we can get more signups for the event and we can also ask her when she finishes the questions to also think of title, of a title for this and heal the like points because then this way will be much easier for you to just put this information to Luma and not think about that.",Podcast Document Process Improvement,"In our current process, Francis typically notifies me when a document lacks a title. I propose that we should also ask Johanna to provide a title when she has questions about it. 

The usual workflow begins with finding a guest and agreeing on a time for their participation. Once we receive confirmation that they want to join, we create a podcast document and include Johanna in the conversation, letting her know about the document's existence and encouraging her to start working on it. 

Recently, we have faced delays in the creation of this document, which has pushed our timeline back significantly. To address this, I suggest that once we agree on a guest, we immediately contact Johanna to inquire when she can complete the document. 

The goal is to announce the event as early as possible to maximize signups. Delaying the announcement until the last minute has resulted in lower attendance rates. In our initial emails to Johanna after confirming a guest, we should mention the new process document and ask her to let us know when she can work on it. We want to publish the information as quickly as possible to increase event registrations.

Additionally, once Johanna has finished drafting the questions, we can ask her to come up with a title for the episode. This way, all relevant information will be readily available for input into Luma without any additional hassle."

audio_130@12-08-2024_18-09-28.ogg,130,2024-08-12 18:09:28,"Well, typically the process is you open the bookkeeping report for a specific month, so there is a date added. This is what we use for splitting between months. And then first there are to-dos, so you go through to-dos. So usually you go to Dropbox, you open the documents, the receipts, the invoices, and then you fill it, replace to-dos with the actual numbers. That's the first part, the first step. Second step is if there are USD or other non-euros, you convert them to euros using the website I gave you. Then once it's done, you go to Revolut and Finom and double-check that we don't have any missing expenses or, what is more important, missing incomes, incoming transactions. And then if there are...

And then once it's done, you go through that process document that you sent, meaning that we prepare the zip archive and upload it to that website I sent you through email. And then we write an email to our accountants saying that the report for this month is ready. Also, when it comes to invoices, we have two folders for invoices. One invoice is like this is the expenses. So this is what we spent. You will also see invoices from Prosilum and basically everything we spent money on. And then the other folder is invoices that we sent. So this is our incoming transactions. So there are two folders. And then there is another folder which is invoices lending, I think. This is when you... I think it was the other process document you mentioned when you just put the file in Dropbox and then it appears in... It tells it to do the spreadsheet. Well, I think that's more or less it. So let's prepare a document where we capture the sequence and we link to this document from the onboarding document. So it's there. And then for each step in this document for preparing this thing, the report, we should link to the relevant process documents.",Bookkeeping Process Overview,"The bookkeeping process begins with opening the bookkeeping report for a specific month, which includes the date for month-to-month tracking. 

Next, you should address the to-dos. Typically, this involves accessing Dropbox to open the relevant documents, including receipts and invoices. Here, you will replace the to-dos with the actual numbers. 

Once that is completed, the second step is to convert any USD or other non-euro amounts into euros using the provided conversion website. 

After conversion, it's important to double-check Revolut and Finom for any missing expenses or, more critically, missing incoming transactions. By ""missing,"" I mean there are transactions we have that are not reflected in the bookkeeping spreadsheet. Add any such transactions to the spreadsheet.

Following that, you'll need to refer to the process document you shared. This involves preparing the zip archive and uploading it to the designated website provided via email. 

Next, an email should be sent to our accountants notifying them that the report for the month is ready. 

Regarding invoices, we maintain two distinct folders. One folder contains invoices related to expenses, showcasing all expenditures, including those from Prosilum. The other folder contains invoices that we sent out, representing our incoming transactions. 

Additionally, there is a third folder for invoices labeled ""lending"" (I believe this is related to a different process document you mentioned). This folder is where invoices are placed in Dropbox, which then automatically updates the to-do spreadsheet.

Finally, let’s draft a document detailing the sequence of these steps and link to this document from the onboarding material. For each step in preparing the report, we should include links to the relevant process documents."

We generate revenue through sponsorships, and I want to keep track of posts like the one from Santiago. Santiago is an influencer, and a company called Box paid him to create a post. This indicates that Box is looking to advertise or promote something. 

We can help these companies by notifying them that we have an audience they can reach.

Since the event is happening today, we will move it to a random future date in Luma and Meetup calendars. This ensures that people are aware the event is not happening as we work on confirming a new date.

It's crucial to make this change as soon as possible to prevent attendees from receiving notifications. If we don't act quickly, they might get a notification stating the event starts in 15 minutes, leading them to join only to find nothing occurring, which can be quite frustrating.

Additionally, on some platforms like Meetup and possibly Luma, if we fail to move the event before it begins, we can no longer edit it. We'll have to create a new event instead, which poses a challenge since people signed up for the original event but not for the new one. This would require us to ask them to sign up again, complicating the situation further.

Given these considerations, I recommend that we create a process document if one doesn't already exist, outlining the steps to handle last-minute rescheduling effectively."

So, like, that's why the question, like, creating an invoice when it's not yet in Phenom, doesn't make much sense, because, like, you create it in Phenom, and then it stays in Phenom. So if it's not in Phenom, you need to create it there, I guess. And this is the only place where we create invoices. And why did you ask that?",Sponsorship and Invoice Process,"It was a bit noisy, so let me continue. If they decide to sponsor us, the next step is to arrange everything for the newsletter. At the same time, we initiate the invoice process.

First, we collect the company’s information, such as name, address, and other relevant details. Then, we create an invoice in Phenom and send it to them for payment. This is how our process works.

Regarding your question about creating an invoice when it's not yet in Phenom, it doesn't make much sense to do that. Invoices should be created in Phenom because that's the only platform we use for this purpose. If it's not in Phenom, we need to create it there.

So, I can call them incoming invoices or I don't know if it's the right name or not. And outcoming invoices is what we send to our clients. So, in my example, with AirByte, if they decide to sponsor our newsletter, then we send them an invoice. I usually just say invoice. But in this case, we send them an invoice. This is the invoice in the terminology I used. This is an outcoming invoice. It's coming from us to them and they have to pay for it.

This serves as confirmation of our payment, which we need to send to our accountants as proof of our expenses. 

Invoices can be categorized as incoming or outgoing. Incoming invoices are those we receive from vendors, while outgoing invoices are what we send to our clients. For example, if AirByte decides to sponsor our newsletter, we would send them an outgoing invoice. 

In this context, I typically refer to this document simply as an invoice. However, it's important to clarify that in this situation, it is an outgoing invoice—one that we issue to the client, who is then required to make a payment.

That's the first sort. And the second one is when we already paid, let's say, using a bank card or something like this, like in case with OpenAI, this is the case. We first pay, and then as a proof of payment, we get the invoice, or sometimes there is a receipt. And usually, like when we have both invoice and receipt, we're interested in the receipt. So for example, in case of OpenAI, we usually have a receipt, so we don't need the invoice. And for example, ProSilo is also, we get a receipt in many services, we have a receipt. So this receipt is just as a proof of payment, it's enough. But sometimes we get just an invoice, no receipt, and it's also fine. And in cases when we first get an invoice, then we need to pay for this invoice. And only then, once we paid, we declare this invoice, we put it to the bookkeeping spreadsheet and Dropbox folder.",Invoice Payment Processes,"When it comes to invoices, there are two main scenarios we encounter. The first scenario is when we receive an invoice that requires payment. In this case, we need to process the payment before we can document it.

The second scenario occurs when we have already made a payment using a bank card or a similar method. An example of this is our dealings with OpenAI, where we first pay for the services and then receive an invoice or receipt as proof of that payment. In these instances, we usually find it more useful to keep the receipt rather than the invoice.

Similarly, with services like ProSilo, we often receive a receipt as proof of payment. A receipt suffices for our records, and we sometimes do not require an invoice at all.

There are also occasions when we only receive an invoice without a corresponding receipt. In such cases, everything is still manageable. For invoices that we receive first, we must pay them, and once payment is completed, we then document the invoice in our bookkeeping spreadsheet and store it in the appropriate Dropbox folder."

I do not need to document Like extra information that is not in process documents that are more like contextual to give context You can for now just put it to like I saw you already put it to your notes Also in the onboarding document, we will figure out how to structure the onboarding document later But like I just want to make sure that everything I say is not lost So you if you don't need know where to put the information that might be important just put it to the onboarding document and then we will find the better place for this or maybe just create a Document with notes where you put your notes and then for each piece of information We will figure out what's the best place where to put it But I just want to make sure that like when I record something a video or a voice note That it gets documented it gets saved somewhere. So then I don't need to say it again and when we Let's say I want to hire help for you like get a second person that the the idea I have in mind is that they just can go through these documents and Have all the context all the information That they need so they will not need to struggle as much as you do with all this Like mess that we have right? So we just want to have more organized and all the information that I say I Want to organize it in such a way that it's easily accessible and readable. So the person can independently read that and Perhaps maybe define it if something is not clear. But yeah, I want our documentation to be In a way better state than it's currently now, of course, there's a lot of work to go there. But at least This is what I have in mind",Organizing Documentation for Clarity,"I understand it might be confusing when I say, ""please make sure everything is documented."" You might wonder what exactly needs to be documented. It's important to note that you don't need to include extra information that is outside of the process documents; instead, focus on context that provides clarity.

For now, you can place any relevant context into your notes or the onboarding document. We will determine how to structure the onboarding document later. My priority is to ensure that everything I communicate is not lost in the process. If you’re unsure where to record important information, feel free to put it into the onboarding document for now. 

Alternatively, we can consider creating a separate document for notes. This way, you can consolidate all your notes, and later we can decide the best locations for each piece of information. The key takeaway is that when I record a video or a voice note, it needs to be documented and saved somewhere. This approach will prevent me from having to repeat myself.

If we decide to hire another person to assist you, my intention is for them to have access to these documents, so they can easily find all the context and information they need. This would alleviate some of the challenges you currently face with the disorganization we have.

Overall, I want our documentation to be in a much more organized and accessible format. This will allow any team member to read through and comprehend the information independently, and they can seek clarification if something is unclear. Although there is a substantial amount of work to do in this regard, this is my vision for our documentation."

Another explanation could be when when our clients pay with a credit card and the money gets to a so-called merchant account and we need to get this money out of this merchant account to the main account, Revolute account. We can have that. And in Finom we also see transactions from Revolute, not always, but sometimes. Sometimes it stops working, so we also need to check Revolute to make sure there are no missing transactions, but this one is a Revolute one because there is this R icon.

We can send it as is, and our accountants will figure it out. One potential explanation for the discrepancy could be related to currency conversion when we change money from USD to EUR. 

Another possibility is linked to how our clients pay with a credit card. In such cases, the funds first go to a merchant account, and we then need to transfer that money to our main Revolut account. 

Additionally, we sometimes see transactions from Revolut in Finom, but not always. Occasionally, the connection stops working, so we need to verify in Revolut to ensure there are no missing transactions. It's worth noting that this particular transaction is from Revolut, indicated by the R icon. 

You can proceed with preparing the invoice despite the date discrepancies; as long as the PDF is included, it should be fine. However, for future transactions, we should aim for greater consistency."
