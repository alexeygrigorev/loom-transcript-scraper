1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,745
uh so I tried to take a look at this and the problem

2
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:08,380
is what I showed you so the problem is you see this not found

3
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:13,447
authors for these emails and this is the problem and

4
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:18,979
I made the error messages a bit more um

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,815
how to say like previously it was not saying which person

6
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:27,890
it was trying to find so you see here in the logs in large

7
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:31,404
it says check in the person and read the trial like this and then

8
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:35,786
says person for file and the petrela already exists which means that if we

9
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:40,542
go to the log's club then I

10
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:45,207
think it's people it's like hidden and we type andy petrela

11
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:50,554
we see him right because he already

12
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:55,069
did something before so we already have a

13
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,895
profile this is why so it exists that is why

14
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:02,708
we do not process it here right?

15
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,024
and,

16
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:09,720
and the status is not processed so we skip it what I can do

17
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:15,017
is maybe just make it done so next time its not processed but

18
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:20,043
umm, there is this process document processing

19
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:24,720
people who are already on the website so it was uHHHH sometime

20
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:29,596
before and we can see here and the engi

21
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:35,514
paterla already exists but later we see engi

22
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:40,047
paterla if- is not found right so it exists but not found

23
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:44,563
at the same time and we have a process document how to process people

24
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:48,418
who are already on the website and this is what you should do so

25
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:52,994
we already have a process document please just go through this process document

26
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:57,815
and rerun one more time and maybe also change

27
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:02,091
this process document to add what I just described so the symptoms like how

28
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:06,827
you can see that this is indeed the problem so and the symptoms are

29
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:09,548
umm.

30
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:14,314
it already exists but here you see in the logs that it's

31
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:18,991
not found and here if we go to this data docs

32
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:23,267
club slash people we can see this person there right so these are the

33
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,927
symptoms. And then it's uhh that's why we need to go through

34
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:32,683
this document. And then on a separate note I want you also

35
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:37,789
like for this document we need to umm umm

36
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,565
rework it a little bit. So first.

37
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:44,540
I want all the process document we have and we will do this when

38
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,683
we go through all this document index.

39
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:52,370
Is if it's page it has pages we need to turn

40
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:56,295
it into pageless. Umm.

41
00:02:56,296 --> 00:03:00,788
So this is. All we do it page set up pageless.

42
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,836
And then we remove all these page breaks.

43
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:11,753
I don't know if I already showed you that but when

44
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:16,366
we revise. It's the process documents we need to do that

45
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:20,701
for all the documents that we have.

46
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,195
We remove page breaks.

47
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:25,527
Alright so you will modify it.

48
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:29,043
This document would also add the,

49
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:32,549
the context, right? Like we discussed.

50
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,163
You will add to why when we need this document.

51
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:40,252
And just follow through this document and you will be able to resolve the

52
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:40,617
problem.
