1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,100
So, I just want to show you how to add links to thriller.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,730
So before the item told the links,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,240
but now I want to show you how to actually do this again.

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:14,640
You don't need to turn this into a protest document.

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:17,790
You just need to do this as a one off.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,130
I think so. Let's see.

7
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:23,190
We want to do is agree on day two and you have a link

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,040
here, this one.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,390
So now let's say we want to edit here.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,960
And for that, I use this index for, let me make it larger.

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,110
So first I use, um,

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,290
yeah, so first I use this brackets and then saying,

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,080
break it, say right link. And then I,

14
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,830
then I use parenthesis and then put the actual link.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,640
So this syntax we Centerlink,

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,550
right? So now we'll you click on this link,

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
a topless link.

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,190
And I actually can now put this in,

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,020
in other player or Prentice, and then I kind of put the apprentice

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,240
in the link and yeah.

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,190
So for example, now change the status to confirm in this schedule a spreadsheet.

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,640
I just know we have this schedule spreadsheet.

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,080
I get a, I get the link around this

24
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,880
spreadsheet here, and then now I need to link

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,860
the link. Yes, it's not available.

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,600
You will need to add this. I'll just do the

27
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:51,390
link. And then Victor here, and

28
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,520
you will do this. And then, um,

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,630
can you please this link to all the things here,

30
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,920
um, and this way we can just, uh,

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,260
you know, when we do a template,

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,970
we just click on this thing and we have the process document

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,100
if it's needed and then all the,

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,350
all the forms. So for example, this one,

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,860
you put the air table form.

36
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:21,570
I think this is quite useful to have

37
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:27,630
it immediately on the checklist here.

38
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,930
And now when you need to introduce you just click on this link and

39
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:41,820
you fill it in and yeah.

40
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,840
And then you mark it. Okay.

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,730
So please do it for the rest of the templates.
