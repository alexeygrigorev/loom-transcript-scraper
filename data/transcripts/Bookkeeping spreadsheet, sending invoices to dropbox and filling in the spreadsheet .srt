1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,010
Um, right. So I wanted to show you how to add the expenses

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,940
to this spreadsheet and this spreadsheet keeping,

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,030
send this spreadsheet. I keep all the expenses.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,920
Yeah. So this is basically a bid date. When the

5
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,860
invoice was issued, this is the date when it was paid,

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,280
but typically, um, for all the expenses,

7
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:30,610
the dates, you shoot them. Date weight is the same.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,030
Usually sometimes, uh, my it's invoice from,

9
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:36,130
for example, um,

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,580
Bayer or invoice from Pablo.

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,200
Sometimes it takes a date, but usually that way on the same day for

12
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:48,520
all the automated services, like the one I am going to show you now.

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,940
So for all these sources, usually the date is the same.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,940
So what I want to show you is, uh,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,730
right now I paid for this thing, Uber suggest,

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,440
so this is a service, almost like a uterus

17
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:06,130
for that. And it's actually, you can see it here.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,930
Hope you can see it on how it looks like on your end.

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,540
So this is the payment and how I want to now add this to

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,170
this spreadsheet. Right? So of course it's possible to do it manually,

21
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,310
but I want to show you an automated way to do this.

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,420
So there's the full I will probably,

23
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:33,760
when you get it, it will be like,

24
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,300
I will.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,690
So when you will get it, maybe I will forward it to you or

26
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:45,300
something that is so let me just do four words.

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,910
Uh it's and I'll forward

28
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:51,900
it to myself to,

29
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,740
yeah. So I we'll do that now.

30
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,410
And yeah, so now you see the payment and usually the,

31
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,020
what you can do to turn this into a PDF.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,530
So we need PDFs here,

33
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,430
support each line here. We need it with the actual expense,

34
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:22,570
like to, uh, to prove that the infection,

35
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,650
somehow I want to create a video from this.

36
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,250
So in g-mail I just do print,

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,400
um, yeah. Uh,

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,920
save it

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,180
Sometimes. So for many things,

40
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,860
EDF will be generated automatically by the service in something stable,

41
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:54,800
not so you need to, um,

42
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,350
pay it immediately. So,

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,080
um, I will save this file and now I

44
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,520
have a special email channel.

45
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:08,800
We'll now use it's called voice.

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,260
So respond through books in west attachment.

47
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,390
I will send you the, this, uh,

48
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,980
um, this email. So this is an automation that will automatically

49
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:26,350
say file to pro books. I will show you to occasional and Alliance.

50
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,890
Yeah. So now with this invoice,

51
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,590
I will attach it, this invoice,

52
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,690
we just paid it

53
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,400
and here in the topics I need to drive to.

54
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,050
So what would it be also file name.

55
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,010
So I will show you throw books in

56
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,860
drug books,

57
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,940
voices folder, you see the way invoices look like the

58
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:12,200
way I own names look pike he's first is date then minus then there

59
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:16,160
is a to here I would suggest.

60
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,590
And what book the file in Dropbox

61
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,710
with date minus. So

62
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:32,090
let me just send it, uh,

63
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,950
I will, uh,

64
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,940
so it might take a bit of time before it works.

65
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,850
Let me see, like maybe one minute or something

66
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:47,360
like this.

67
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,540
Yeah. We'll just put it on pause.

68
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,650
Okay. So we see that this thing appears here.

69
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,770
It didn't appear yet in a Dropbox.

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,930
Maybe they just need to adjust the question.

71
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,080
So now either in robots I'm

72
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,560
open it

73
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,400
and we see them some ways.

74
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,900
Okay. Now you see like

75
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,220
edit this line here. So I need to change it's five minutes.

76
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:37,370
So Uber suggest. Yeah. And then,

77
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,580
so this is the provider. This is the company that they should,

78
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,740
the invoice in this form,

79
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,670
what we need to write, what exactly was the thing that,

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,360
so I will open it and I will see that we paid

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,480
or this month set up.

82
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:58,760
Um,

83
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,590
So now we need to do this. So this one,

84
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:20,360
the invoice is in euros. That's why we don't need anything in this column.

85
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,130
So in this column would have the price in the United States.

86
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,210
So we only care about response. So for this one,

87
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:32,150
the price is 419.

88
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,550
So I need to write minus four condoms because

89
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,070
this is paid for this.

90
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,590
That's why it's negative. So when it's income,

91
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:45,140
it's positive when it's expense,

92
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:49,210
it's negative. And so,

93
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,120
yeah. Let me also show you too.

94
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,120
Uh, you will be seen. So usually the way I do,

95
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,650
I just send email to this address to

96
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:07,170
be S suggest, where

97
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:10,360
did they send it to

98
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,600
this one? And then,

99
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,860
um, I send it and then let's say at the end of the day,

100
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,730
or the end of the week, I come to the spreadsheet and it will

101
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,250
be sent. So now I want to show you how to deal.

102
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,320
So go and I want to do,

103
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,270
oops, sorry.

104
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,520
I want to take care of this one.

105
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,210
So I want to care this slide. All right.

106
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,640
So in norm we see slide off and we

107
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,090
pay

108
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,490
again. It was uterus since here.

109
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,130
Let me check here.

110
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,410
I just opened the inwards,

111
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,760
All the noise and here

112
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,050
is engage in OPA.

113
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,850
Um, yeah, let me show you how I feel.

114
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,480
So MailChimp should be like

115
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:50,160
capital. So usually, so this like automatically gets their file

116
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:55,110
name here, and then I manually change it in the spreadsheet.

117
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,960
So MailChimp and what's

118
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,320
so standard plan.

119
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,460
Yeah.

120
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,740
And then I want to show you these two things like how I see.

121
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,720
So it's actually in the, I think

122
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:29,360
it should be here. So MailChimp, you see,

123
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:33,920
because MailChimp charges in the dollars and then there is a

124
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:39,680
conversion to uterus. So I take this one and

125
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,210
we'll here and it seems is European.

126
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:49,580
It's a German thing. So it dots in

127
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:52,010
numbers. So I need to replace the dot.

128
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,120
And here, I think here

129
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:05,070
I've looked at things in uterus. All

130
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,750
the bookkeeping was

131
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,910
in Germany and in dollars.

132
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,950
And then for this type of fury, let me see what's into,

133
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,600
um, it's update,

134
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,580
email updated.

135
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,730
And then for this one, unfortunately I didn't pay it wrong.

136
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,480
You know, I paid it from my other car,

137
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,730
just my personal one. I don't know for some reasons or high-purity it

138
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,830
was attached.

139
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,160
Um, it will save.

140
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,670
So I didn't use this one so that one I will have to,

141
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,550
uh, to feel and myself.

142
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,620
Yeah. So this is how this looks like.

143
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,110
Um, they have a system that they use for even the same,

144
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,980
usually. So for example, let me show you how I do with this with

145
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:29,410
MailChimp. I don't know if you folks have access to this.

146
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,610
Maybe you will,

147
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,560
students in MailChimp.

148
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,870
So when I get the notification that MailChimp charters,

149
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,870
something, so these is the MailChimp,

150
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,860
right? So then they usually send invoice.

151
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,780
So the invoice is often billing,

152
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,270
reading history.

153
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,780
And I can see this one,

154
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,660
I suppose, be the latest payment.

155
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,550
So I can just click view.

156
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,160
And then like, it's the same, the same thing as we did last

157
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:34,470
time, as I showed you, you see my,

158
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,040
to, uh, you send this email to this email,

159
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,740
so I will actually send it to

160
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:44,310
you right now.

161
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,390
I will include this. Yeah. So you send

162
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:05,300
it to email central box.

163
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,680
So I think that it will be moral. So what I think when you

164
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,760
now make sense to you, maybe be R and

165
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:23,740
R documents in our process

166
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,290
docs, come on log.

167
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,490
So maybe the older keeping

168
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,590
Voices and let's start there.

169
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,800
And I think from this video, you will a like

170
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,840
Tuesday may be, so yeah,

171
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,810
I hope it wasn't too much. Yeah.

172
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,620
Diesel.
