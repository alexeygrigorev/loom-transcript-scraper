1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,740
Yeah. So tomorrow we'll have, okay.

2
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:07,650
I wanted to show you how I make announcements there.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,250
Sorry. Now it's evening.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,510
So usually the announcement is for a morning,

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,210
I'll show you all. I do this. So this is the announcement

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,000
last week. So what I usually do is paint properly,

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,290
but then instead of copying from the previous,

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,560
we could just put a template in Fluxus doc,

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,590
but this is how I do it right now. And then I incorporate

10
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:48,660
the name of the book, which is this one official introduction and

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,240
basically place the book name, and then,

12
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:56,670
uh, this name.

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,690
Yeah. So I, I talk the guests,

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,650
um, the, the mucosa, if it's one that could smoke the play,

15
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:09,240
I talk to them, all of them. Now I need to

16
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:13,200
place these, um, this discussion.

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,570
So for that table here,

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,190
and then I take this, so this one about discount,

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,980
uh, yeah, this is not really part of the description

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,730
here. It should be Mandrake machine here.

21
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,860
We kept playing great, but here we do not.

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,120
And then I don't this one link to you and I had a picture,

23
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,450
so I already downloaded the picture.

24
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,400
So if I didn't have it, I would maybe just do this same

25
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,770
has Colver,

26
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,520
whatever. So just any name?

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,360
Well, not the name, because the name will be actually visible.

28
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,890
Like you see here for funders, there's this name since

29
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,500
I'm just put any name, something sensible,

30
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,920
and now I could see here to the cover apart

31
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:25,740
from the computer. And then I selected.

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,660
Yeah. So this is stepping and

33
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,700
instead of posting it right away,

34
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,900
I schedule it for later custom time.

35
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,670
So I usually schedule it for 7:30 AM,

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,780
uh, central European time, and

37
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:53,410
then it just kicks kid off and yeah,

38
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,130
the message will be sent to, to this channel.

39
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,780
And then what

40
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:01,600
<v 1>I do the morning, I also,

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,830
once these messages, uh,

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,390
probably I also make an announcement like,

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,310
um,

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,100
like this one. So we'll show you how to do this,

45
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,940
but also I make an announcement in their announcement channel,

46
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,570
how I schedule their announcements for the week events.
