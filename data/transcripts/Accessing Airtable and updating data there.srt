00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,090
Hi, I just saved password to air table to our last

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,880
class. So I want to show you a few things in the air table

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,160
account. So this is the thing that he used for creating forms and

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,050
yeah, so we're interested in these other ways, DTC org and in this,

5
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:22,380
uh, so this is where all the things that you create,

6
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:25,620
this is where they end up in. And here,

7
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:29,670
I wanted to show you how to change an event title that you submitted

8
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:34,200
through the form. So here I'll click on

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:38,730
expand and here the event type you submitted here,

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,760
um, well, it should be different, right?

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,680
Or that's why I go to Devon drive to get the correct title.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,790
The one that you ablated

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,580
Come on.

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,390
Yeah. So this one is productionizing the feature store for fraud detection.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,430
So copy the Euro

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,980
And yeah, you can get the title and

17
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:18,930
click here. So this is how you update a form that you're already submitted

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,810
through air table. And I think they don't do,

19
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,900
I can just close it. Yeah. He told them why the case has the

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,220
updated version. Let me check a FedEx.

21
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,100
So it's uh, 6 0 7 0 7.

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,750
Yeah, this is the correct one. Um,

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,620
and then once I processed this, the status will change from,

24
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,910
uh, uh, empty to Dan and here in grid view,

25
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,810
you see all the past events that I already processed.

26
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,030
And by the way, you accidentally last time you edit two records

27
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,490
for the same event, please be careful.

28
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,180
And now you can actually log into air table and see in check or

29
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:08,160
what you actually submitted to use inform was actually better.

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,380
But yeah, this is in case you accidentally put something incorrectly through the forum.

31
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,920
Now you can log in to this account and,

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,170
uh, yeah, she had the data.
