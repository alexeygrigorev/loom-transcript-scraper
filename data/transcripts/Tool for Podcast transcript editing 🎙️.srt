1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,587
So I've been working on this tool that can edit podcasts

2
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:10,637
for us so we don't need to rely on freelancers and

3
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:14,557
this is how it works so I will send this link I will add

4
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:19,406
it to loom and then here again it also works

5
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:24,012
through GitHub actions like other things we have have used before

6
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:29,441
so you go to actions and here we have two

7
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:34,450
actions first is submit and then the second so check to submit

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,562
is what we use and check is automatic but we can also trigger it

9
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:43,351
so the way it works is we use an external service for creating a

10
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:48,901
transcript uh and these transcripts are not

11
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:53,650
really good we need to edit them later so first

12
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:59,028
i'll show you how to submit a transcript job so i click

13
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:03,775
here run workflow and we select

14
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:09,504
the video we want to transcribe so this would be a podcast episode uh

15
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:14,233
let's see uh yeah so i wanted to take this one

16
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:19,100
with savina right so now we are interested in

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,126
this id that goes after e and for this

18
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:29,225
so basically this part everything going that goes uh between v and this

19
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:33,854
ampersand this is what we're interested in right so we can check if

20
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:39,629
this is the right one by using this url without anything

21
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,598
just a question mark v equals and then oops putting

22
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:49,946
the id there right so this should work still okay

23
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:54,753
it works and now i again i am here actions

24
00:01:55,474 --> 00:02:00,181
i select submit transcribe job i click on run workflow run

25
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:06,582
workflow and put the idea here and then i click run what

26
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:11,229
will happen is actually i run it already let me do it for another

27
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:15,293
one but i want to continue all it already finished so i want to

28
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:20,001
show using this example but let me also do it with another

29
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:25,919
one so let's say

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,987
we want to take um i'll just take some so

31
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:35,975
one i'm just thinking which one did i not because i did some experiments

32
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:40,538
and already uh processed i think this one ones so

33
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,044
uh let's take this one with daniel

34
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:54,261
again we're interested only in the part after b so

35
00:02:54,321 --> 00:03:00,050
i put the id here and click run run workflow right

36
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:04,617
now it will appear here okay so it

37
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:09,545
appears here uhm and then yeah it

38
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,031
does some technical things well at the And it should success,

39
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:15,947
succeed out.

40
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:19,172
Let's just put it on pause for now and then let's wait till it

41
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:23,078
finishes. Okay, it took some time,

42
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,705
so it finished. Now I go again back to

43
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:33,274
the repo. And what happens is

44
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:36,881
it creates a file here in the jobs directory.

45
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:41,492
So this is technical, we don't need to know what exactly it is here,

46
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,556
this is some technical information,

47
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,324
but the fact is that we should have a file,

48
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:54,488
podcast, miners, and the idea of the thing that we want

49
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:58,575
to transcribe, right? And now there is another action.

50
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:02,603
Right now, we just submitted a job and then in the background,

51
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:04,866
the transcribed transcription. will happen,

52
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:10,266
right? And then this submit transcribe job runs periodically,

53
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,906
like every 5 to 10 minutes, maybe like every 20 minutes.

54
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,860
Uhm. I don't know, well,

55
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:19,585
it runs periodically, right?

56
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:23,092
So what can happen is maybe you submit it,

57
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:26,078
then you can uhm do some other things.

58
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:29,062
Then maybe in 10 minutes,

59
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:32,922
uh, it should run, uh,

60
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:36,022
it should run automatically, if it does not,

61
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:39,920
because it sometimes may take longer, like after 10 minutes,

62
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,588
the transcription should be on. So you can go

63
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,332
and click on this check transcribe jobs,

64
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,890
run workflow, again run workflow. And now it will use this file,

65
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:56,755
this json file that we created previously.

66
00:04:57,115 --> 00:05:00,341
It created automatically this with some technical information.

67
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:07,190
In order to check the status of the transcription okay

68
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:13,323
let's see if it run anything so

69
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:18,152
um yeah we can see that this is uh is still in progress

70
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:21,819
right so I'll put it on pause give it some time and come back

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,728
like in five to ten minutes and then we'll see what to

72
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:31,577
do after that okay hopefully enough time has passed

73
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:36,205
let me see what happened uh so it was still a manual job that

74
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:41,172
I run so it didn't run the scheduled job

75
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:44,478
um so what I can do now is try to run it one more

76
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:50,269
time one more time so run workflow and

77
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:55,365
then let's see see what happens there

78
00:05:55,366 --> 00:06:00,895
should be here we go so we just check

79
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:07,149
again the same like this one is not interesting uh

80
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:12,378
let me just collapse it so this this one is interesting so

81
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:17,194
it says that transcription it uh transcript saved to

82
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:21,842
this directory right so now this is the location where

83
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:26,968
it's saved let me copy paste it to my clipboard

84
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:31,855
now i go here transcripts

85
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:36,603
row and this is i just use search and

86
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:42,039
this is now we can also see that it is updated now right so

87
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,728
this is the transcription and

88
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:52,351
this transcription is not really good so we need to edit it and

89
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:59,562
for that i have a prompt for charge bt uh

90
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:03,892
so this is the prompt so there are multiple options prompts here we are

91
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:08,821
interested in the first one and we will probably keep updating

92
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:14,531
this prompt so i create a new chat

93
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:19,600
and here we need to uh replace a few things so

94
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:24,109
there are placeholders first guest name i think it was

95
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,487
uh

96
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:40,212
daniel right um the one so

97
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:45,582
let's put his name here guest name is

98
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,585
daniel and here we take the entire document

99
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:55,403
that we uh prepared and

100
00:07:55,483 --> 00:08:01,648
put it here questions right and

101
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:07,008
now we execute that so

102
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:11,416
now it says okay i'm ready to edit the transcript so this is the

103
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:16,196
transcript all and i'll just copy the entire transcript

104
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:22,067
i actually haven't tried to run the entire transcript let's see

105
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:26,664
what happens before i did this in chunks uhm

106
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:28,548
but let's see, okay

107
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:37,389
so typically yeah

108
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,017
we're not really interested in that part so we start from

109
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:46,805
from this one right um and okay I'll let

110
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:51,316
it finish so I'll put it on pause right now and I

111
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:57,007
don't know how long it will take um but let's wait okay

112
00:08:57,008 --> 00:09:00,281
now you see it stopped generating so it did not take finish and then

113
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:05,690
it offers me continue generating so I just click on that and

114
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:10,358
now it continues yeah so probably

115
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:14,387
it will finish soon so it of course we would we gave it a

116
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:19,015
lot of text so that's why it takes a bit of time uh

117
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:23,921
to to do that what I did in my past previous experiments is

118
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:28,522
I took it in chunks of 10 minutes so let's say I go to

119
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:33,342
I don't know 15 minutes maybe up to to

120
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:36,711
that point doesn't matter right so I take chunks and then I feed it

121
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:41,458
chunk by chunk so if in the future um

122
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,945
it happens that ChargerBT cannot take the entire thing we can split it into

123
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:50,477
chunks and do that okay so it finished

124
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:58,977
now uh I go here and copy

125
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:05,567
it I will create a new file uh

126
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:08,652
so we can call it like do we have a place where we store

127
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:16,153
transcripts maybe we do but we'll see transcript daniel

128
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:21,381
we can also put season name and episode name whatever

129
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:25,700
I don't remember which one and I copy the entire thing here or I

130
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,268
use ctrl um edit paste without

131
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:34,759
formatting right this is not

132
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,589
uhm yet ready ok so first I

133
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:45,079
remove the intro ok this week ok

134
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,768
apart from that we don't need to do any editing this is not ready

135
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:54,476
yet where is the name script

136
00:10:55,398 --> 00:11:00,349
daniel uh something like that okay

137
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,317
it's saved um it's not ready yet i will record another video

138
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:11,033
of how to finish it what okay

139
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:15,602
um so we still need to add a few touches it's

140
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:20,316
almost ready uh we uh remember in what Pavel says

141
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:26,004
do we have uh his transcripts okay

142
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:34,352
so in his transcripts what he also makes is he

143
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:39,381
adds these captions right there for each chapter there is a caption so

144
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:43,769
this is what we will do next I don't have a video yet so

145
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,931
I will prepare uh that and we'll share it with you too but this

146
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:52,038
is how we create uh this is how we submit a transcript job this

147
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,601
is how we get the results and this is how we edit

148
00:11:56,602 --> 00:12:01,098
the results with chargebt and by the way one thing i did not mention

149
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:06,488
that the file remember we had here this jobs

150
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:11,249
uh one of the jobs this json file with daniel's podcast it's

151
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,009
gone so after it successfully processes it it removes that

152
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,582
from this jobs directory and it places © The Bulletproof 2013 transcript in

153
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:25,530
the role folder okay so that's uh

154
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,875
the main part i would say now we just need to i'll just need

155
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:33,793
to figure out how to add um captions the titles for sections

156
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:39,007
and then from that we will be able to create the same documents

157
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:42,212
in the same format as pavel creates so then we will be able to

158
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:46,832
use it for the rest of the flow that we have so yeah,

159
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,258
see you around
