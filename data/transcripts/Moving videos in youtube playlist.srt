1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,090
Um, hi. So I wanted to show you how to,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,090
you probably know this, how to rearrange,

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,930
uh, videos in a playlist. So let's take this one.

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,650
So you recently uploaded this video and this one.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,490
Okay. So for this one, uh,

6
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:19,210
I actually want to move it here.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,730
So after office hours, and I think it will be

8
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:29,050
nice to add that it's a homework solution by [Inaudible] Taang.

9
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:34,090
Yeah. Can you please, uh, add this to the title and

10
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:36,770
then, Yeah, I think we're missing a happen here.

11
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:40,410
Can you please add it here and then when we have,

12
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,250
uh, homework number four and you will upload it.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,970
So it should go after office hours here,

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,170
then with the rest of the office hours. I think that is fine.

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,970
And then another thing I wanted to show you now go back,

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,010
um, yeah, this, this one machine learning zoom camp.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,090
So you just it to videos, right?

18
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:07,250
So these two videos are here at end and

19
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:11,930
now we need to, because you see they're 7.1 and then they're at

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,610
at end. So we now need to move them all the way up

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,930
here between, uh, <affirmative> six and

22
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,610
eight, right? And then, um,

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,850
I'll do it the same with this one,

24
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,330
but then for the new ones that you upload,

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,370
please also put it here in the right order,

26
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,130
In the playlist, eh,

27
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:42,530
come

28
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,250
<v 1>On. Okay.

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,410
Will not always have, like usually when I ask you to upload a video

30
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,930
and get it to a playlist, you usually don't need to do any of

31
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:54,130
that. But sometimes I will probably say that.

32
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,490
Okay. Make them in the right order.

33
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,050
And yeah, this is, uh, if you don't know what the right order is,

34
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,490
just ask me. But here, in this case,

35
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:09,010
they have numbers, so then it's more or less easy to figure out

36
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:13,410
where they should go. So for the new videos that we will upload from

37
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:16,770
here that I just asked you to upload, um,

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,290
yeah, please put them where is please put them also

39
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,270
in the right position. Okay.
