1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,340
Oh, hi. So I wanted to change this,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,100
um, sponsorship CRM a little bit.

3
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:11,140
So instead of sponsored content, I'll name it just content because

4
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,060
sometimes the content is, uh, not sponsored,

5
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:16,860
but still I want to reach out to the company who organizes,

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,140
uh, something and, um,

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,940
offer them sponsorships. So a good example is this Snowflake

8
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,970
built, right?

9
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:31,090
So Snowflake is, uh,

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,170
let me remove this part. Um,

11
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:38,610
so Snowflake is, um, a company we already have them in,

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,260
um, Oops,

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,500
here, and they organize the conference.

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,540
So I want to add the conference here so we can offer

15
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,900
them sponsorship, uh,

16
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,660
promotion of this conference. So I'll do,

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,300
uh, the data Snowflake Bill 22?

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,060
No,

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:02,660
<v 1>Like

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,700
Build 22. What's the,

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,460
the data cloud of Summit.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,740
The data

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,020
<v 1>Cloud

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,420
Of Summit, right? So content type is,

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,570
um, conference.

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,330
So it's Event. Event,

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,730
right? Source.

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,090
Uh, it's kind of newsletter,

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,730
but, uh, yeah, here since for the source,

30
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,090
let's only keep the source that is,

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,370
uh, like, you know, paid source.

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,170
And so here it's their own newsletter.

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,490
So here I'll just, uh, maybe have an option,

34
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:45,930
something like, uh, organic.

35
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,940
Yeah, so it means it's, uh, their own stuff.

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,780
Relevance is, uh, let's say Medium and companies Northlake.

37
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:00,220
We already have them. It's Snowflake and Comment is,

38
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:04,060
uh, so when is it?

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,130
<v 1>It's

40
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:06,930
November.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,090
<v 1>Just

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,570
Then. Uh, we don't have anyone from Snowflake yet,

43
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,360
so we probably should. Uh, cause I see that they are sponsoring

44
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,200
quite many things. So some of these,

45
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,080
uh, content is organics because it's their own.

46
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,480
Some of the content is, uh, like they're actually sponsoring.

47
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,880
So it would be a good idea to get in touch with somebody from

48
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,680
Snowflake and offer them some,

49
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,720
um, like some help with promoting content.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,970
Okay. So yeah, the way I think I wanted to show you here is

51
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:53,610
that, uh, previously I intended to use this thing only as a,

52
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,490
You know, a way to capture all sponsored content,

53
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,560
but sometimes there is also organic content that could also be relevant because this

54
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:05,760
is something we want to help them promote. Right.

55
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,400
Okay. And, um, I don't think you need to,

56
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,840
uh, like maybe in the process doc,

57
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,240
when you say how exactly they need to select,

58
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,920
um, content, type, and source,

59
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,600
you can mention that, uh, like organic should be if it's,

60
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,440
you know, their own, um,

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,400
their own content. And an example of that would be a newsletter,

62
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,360
their own newsletter that they use for sponsoring this stuff.

63
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:36,120
Or for, not, sorry, sponsoring but promoting this stuff.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,690
Okay.
