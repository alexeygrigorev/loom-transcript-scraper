1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,440
Uh, hi. So with this video, we still have the problem of delayed sound.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,520
So if I go

3
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:08,000
<v 1>Here like Ang and Vs, which

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,680
Is like Unsynchronized for some reasons,

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,600
um, there is back on YouTube and it takes,

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,000
uh, it's already been since Friday, right?

7
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,560
So when this problem proceeds,

8
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,680
and now it's Tuesday, right?

9
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:25,240
So like it's been for four days. And when we go here to edit,

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,640
we see that like an editor,

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,320
<v 2>Uh,

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,560
Yeah, they say

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,060
in the video, this event is brought to you by Databox Club,

14
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:44,340
which is a community of people.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,740
<v 1>And that was the real value, not

16
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,780
The, I have no idea why this is happening.

17
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,860
Um, and here,

18
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,540
yeah, that's really weird.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,370
<v 1>This is one isn't Shimer bag.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,050
Yeah. So what I do in these cases,

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,650
I figured this out, is when we download the video,

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,770
<v 2>Um,

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,210
So I can just go to, uh,

24
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:16,850
here's this download. Uh, I don't think it works.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,890
So I go to studio,

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,300
studio content and here live and

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,820
here I click this thing and download,

28
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:37,020
right? So then it downloads the video. And when I download the video,

29
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,780
it's actually, hi everyone, welcome to our event

30
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,260
<v 1>From [Inaudible]. You

31
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:45,260
See, it's, uh, I'm wondering how did it happen that you managed to sell

32
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:47,540
something, to sell an idea? What I,

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,700
and then what I do next is I applaud it.

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,940
So like the usual process of uploading, you know,

35
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:55,420
how to do this and, uh,

36
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,580
yeah. Here, here,

37
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:00,660
yeah. So this is the usual, uh,

38
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:03,940
process of applauding, uh, and then the title is the same.

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,500
Fix it. Uh, I,

40
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,180
oops, I'll just put here note,

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,980
fix it. Sound right.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,420
And then, um, so we,

43
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,820
let me download the picture from here.

44
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,540
Yeah, it's kind of not good. Uh, but yeah,

45
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,300
like you probably would, uh, use a different picture in the one that is

46
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,100
larger.

47
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,460
<v 2>So

48
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:34,180
Let me just take, uh,

49
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,580
yeah, why it's not good. But,

50
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:40,100
uh, yeah, please. Uh, yeah,

51
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:43,340
I don't think we, I should actually use this one.

52
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,340
<v 2>Uh, let me

53
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:48,300
See if we have this. I'll put it on pause for for a second.

54
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,020
Okay. I don't, uh,

55
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,820
know how to find it. I probably should download it from Evan Bright,

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,140
but this is how I usually do this.

57
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,640
Okay, so I downloaded the video. So then I put playlist data,

58
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,040
data doc club, podcast. Um,

59
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,600
now here you should put the links from here.

60
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,080
Uh, yeah, we don't have the links. Uh, by the way wise,

61
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,880
we still don't have links. We should have links here.

62
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,520
But yeah, please add the links once we have there.

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,720
Please update, um, the

64
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:23,000
description. Um,

65
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,880
and then what I do next is, uh,

66
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,080
my occasional stuff organization is off.

67
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,320
Uh, then visibility.

68
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,160
Yeah, off. Okay,

69
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:38,480
sorry, I got distracted. So here we select public.

70
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,520
So the video is public and the rest,

71
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,520
I don't think we need to do anything. I mean,

72
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:48,480
you'll need to update description and update a thumbnail,

73
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,760
but the rest we don't need to change.

74
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,600
And yeah, just publish it.

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,360
And then we get the link from here,

76
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,560
copy the link and I go here,

77
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,760
I think. Yeah, here,

78
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:18,600
uh, dated version in description.

79
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,400
So you add a note here and then

80
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,200
You put here updated insertion with description editing

81
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:34,880
here. Then you remove it from the playlist and you make

82
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:38,000
it unlisted and save it.

83
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,260
Alright? All right. So this is how you do it.

84
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:47,100
And then for everything we use this link,

85
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,860
not this one. So this is the old livestream

86
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,900
<v 1>Of, uh, of, of the

87
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:58,460
Com with bad sound. But yeah,

88
00:04:58,461 --> 00:04:59,100
we use,

89
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,020
<v 2>Hmm,

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,300
Why? It's not edit.

91
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah, probably they didn't put it yet.

92
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:24,720
It's public. It should be in the channel. Yeah,

93
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:29,800
I think it'll appear now here. So then for all the future stuff,

94
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:32,200
like when we upload the podcast,

95
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,320
et cetera, we use this new version,

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,800
right? Uh,

97
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:41,600
yeah, it'll appear here right now. So this is how we handle this station.

98
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,880
When after, I don't know,

99
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:46,360
three, four days, the old version is still,

100
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,280
uh, has problems. We can re-app upload it,

101
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,560
uh, and add the link here,

102
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,640
right? So yeah, this is how we do it.
