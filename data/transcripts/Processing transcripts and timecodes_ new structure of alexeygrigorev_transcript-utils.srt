1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,060
I changed the structure of this suppository with transcript reviews.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,160
So previously it was only the case in time quotes these things,

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,060
right? So these things that we put to YouTube,

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,110
I changed it a bit. So now actually time codes,

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,870
goals go to time codes,

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,450
folder. And then now there is another folder.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,310
So before timecards were going to transcripts,

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,160
but this is a bit misleading. So now transcripts contains transcripts.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,280
And later on, when we will process the transcript

10
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,530
from that, he created that something,

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,300
I will show you how to add this transcript to the website right now,

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,220
if we go to the public side, I just added the podcast

13
00:00:56,221 --> 00:01:00,090
episode and you see it, doesn't have this thing here.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,270
So there is not transcript yet, um,

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,350
with Ellen because it's not 3d. So now,

16
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:12,300
because we have these things, now I will show you later how

17
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:16,830
to use these things. There's transcripts at

18
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,980
the task to the website. Okay.

19
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,700
So just to summarize now,

20
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,160
time codes now, after you upload,

21
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,980
I think two X, two docs order,

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,130
and action will be executed. And time of course will appear in the times

23
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:39,360
code folder and transcripts will appear in the transcripts folder.

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,640
Typically you will not need to do anything with transcripts when we have

25
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,260
them in time, but when they are later and we need to do something

26
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,850
with them, we'll need this.
