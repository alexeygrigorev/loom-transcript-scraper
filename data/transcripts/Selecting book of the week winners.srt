1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,730
So what the book of the week,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,490
um, the author said that he wants to slick the purse

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,540
in there randomly. So first they want to take part

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,640
in the discussion or ask the question,

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,890
c****** area name.

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,790
Then after I do this, we need to select to have,

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,640
And already it's there since keeping,

8
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,460
we also ask the question,

9
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,710
We need to slip the unique names. People will ask at least

10
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,340
one question.

11
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,550
So then it's me

12
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,610
A few people ask questions.

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,310
Um, Tim already asked the question and then we're doing this up to this

14
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:34,290
announcement. So from this announcement to do and

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,420
expect, we'll ask the policeman question now

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,350
a little bit, so that actually

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,570
any more, and that was kind of important.

18
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,340
So I wanted to know as I want to take this list and what

19
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:59,900
this tool is, the random work list here.

20
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,490
So this thing shuffles back a compromise,

21
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,300
and then yeah,

22
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,920
they are in that order. So I take them and

23
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,520
now I select the first five. So this will be the winners of the

24
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:19,580
book. You can see that the order is actually around them.

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,300
Then when you think the

26
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:29,100
damn stamp, okay,

27
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,000
the winners. So this people will get the book and now

28
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,380
I need to get an announcement. So this will be the announcement.

29
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,480
They start the windows

30
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,040
In this announcement, in

31
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,960
their score month's book.

32
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,140
So the author on this week is there is so much way

33
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:02,830
that is now.

34
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,880
So I'll add, so this way it's like attack

35
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,480
them. Please send me your emails in team.

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,310
So this is the usual phrase that we have when we have books from

37
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:22,660
publishers. So month's book is self published,

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,480
so that's why I need to collect these emails

39
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,790
myself. I think so. Um,

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,520
and you know, she will arrange the book.

41
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,770
So usually it's the publisher.

42
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,010
So thanks so much for taking part. And thank you.

43
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:55,390
So we need to take the author here and now I'm just going to

44
00:03:55,391 --> 00:04:00,020
leave this and Austin and

45
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:03,610
to see I liked it there names.

46
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,970
Yeah, this is how I announced winners form.
