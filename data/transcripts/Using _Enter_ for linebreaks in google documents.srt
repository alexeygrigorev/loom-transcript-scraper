00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,190
Hi. So I noticed that in most documents that we have,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,870
uh, for podcast, so it seems like instead of using a line

3
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:11,670
break, uh, instead of just heating enter,

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,550
you do shift enter. So these are two different things.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,030
Uh, so let me show you why it matters. So when I click on

6
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:22,590
this thing, you see the entire paragraph is selected.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,070
Mm. So here it thinks that this is the entire paragraph.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,070
So when you do, um,

9
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:34,950
shift enter, it keeps it as one paragraph,

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,630
right? And when you just do enter, it's a different paragraph.

11
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:42,070
So you see when I double click on this, this thing is not selected

12
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:46,550
anymore. So we need to split these things into multiple paragraphs.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,670
So let me actually do this now. And then you see when I just

14
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:55,110
double click on this, I select only this sentence,

15
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:57,350
this paragraph. And here, yeah,

16
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:01,950
the entire thing is selected. So typically I need to redo

17
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:05,750
this. And then I thought, Okay, like maybe I should just record,

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,350
record the video where I show you how I want you to do this.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,390
So please just use simple enter.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,670
And then again, I think I mentioned that, um,

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,030
when something does not make sense,

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,950
not grammatically, but uh, you know,

23
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,990
from the common sense point of view,

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,270
like I know you are having now.

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,070
Like it doesn't make any sense, right?

26
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:32,950
So in this case, maybe heaven is not the right word,

27
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,910
right? So maybe in this case, uh,

28
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:38,790
that would've been nice. Uh, if you can just,

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,190
uh, you know, highlight it, it's not a problem.

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,350
I fix it. Um, but yeah,

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,710
like sometimes before the interview starts,

32
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:51,230
I forget to check the document and then it might be confusing for the

33
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:53,430
guest, um, what we mean here.

34
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,110
Okay, Here, uh, let me,

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,150
it enters again.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,390
So you see, this is how I check if this is the,

37
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,190
the right line break. You see now?

38
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,390
Yeah, it's select everything.

39
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,350
<v 1>Yeah.

40
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,810
And the last one. Okay,

41
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,410
cool. I think now is good.

42
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,450
So please, uh, just the process document that we haven't mentioned,

43
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:33,130
what kind of line breaks should be there when you put,

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,570
um, the content, uh, when

45
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:42,170
you put the content of this document, uh, for this podcast document.

46
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,970
And in general, like unless you have a reason to use,

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,090
uh, shift, don't use it.
