Hi. So, um, thanks for,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,790
oh, what's going on? So thanks for preparing this link,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,830
um, in Luma. So I wanted to show you what to do next with

4
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:14,350
this, uh, link to Luma. I already showed you this project of

5
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:17,510
the week thing. So this is the, the week,

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,190
and I just sent you an and white this thing here.

7
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:23,590
So please accept the invite. Once you do this,

8
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:27,150
you will be able to edit things here, and then you will just need

9
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,510
to click on this, uh,

10
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:35,910
pen pencil. And then now we will need to add

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,910
this link to the button. So here, this is the button.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,590
This one is the button. So we need to replace this to do with,

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,270
oh, the first thing of, to do. And then put the link there and

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,110
yeah, that's how you put the link to this project of week.

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,790
And now let's check it. So now I click on this and we get

16
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:01,270
to this page. So next time when I send you this page,

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,350
you can create an event Luma, and immediately edit this and

18
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,390
add the link to the event you just created.

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,270
Okay.
