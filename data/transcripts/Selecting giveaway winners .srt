1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,600
<v 1>Um, so remember this, we need,

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,060
so give away the book. So now I want to select the winners.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,420
So I copy this hero.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,020
So I go to this tutor, select directions,

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,290
and then we have select winners here.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,450
I, um, I click around for three

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,610
euros here that I just copied from here,

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,520
and then they can run workflow. So know it will take

9
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:38,800
a bit of time to actually run this either.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,020
Let's give it a bit of time. Um,

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,900
oh, it shouldn't be too long.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,360
Yeah. Like here, what it's doing. Exactly.

13
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:59,580
It's not super important, but yeah, we see that it finished now

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,110
we'll go back and we see that there

15
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:11,880
is this folder winners and there is this suite.

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,950
So this is the Euro, just in case they copied there.

17
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,160
There is no nothing else, but this,

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,980
but yeah, just this up.

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,160
And, uh, 10, 10 minutes.

20
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,870
Um, we say we give five copies.

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,460
So we just, from these five, we get stop the

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,050
top five and decide the winners or the book.

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,760
And what I will do now is something like,

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,620
uh,

25
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,050
uh, I don't remember

26
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,820
what I wrote last time. I think last time we did some texts,

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,360
um,

28
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,940
<v 1>DM me and

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,250
um, last time it was something now on the spot.

30
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah. Let's so this is the message. So we will actually do this,

31
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:36,090
not from my account. Uh, maybe I will also ask you to do it

32
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:40,080
from my account, but now, uh, but probably you will do this from not

33
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,080
from my account, but from data docs,

34
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:47,700
but I can't. So I think in the previous

35
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,390
email, I in the previous gave you the template.

36
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,920
Yeah. Depending on. So I'll just think about this a little bit,

37
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,440
how to phrase it better. But the important part here is this is how

38
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:06,690
you select, so this is how you select

39
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,370
the winners for in giveaways.
