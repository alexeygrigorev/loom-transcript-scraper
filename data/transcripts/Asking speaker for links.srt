1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,970
Um, Hey, just wanted to mention,

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:07,440
to do, give me a comment about this email.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,630
So we don't need this LinkedIn to interrupt site.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,950
Typically we already have this. So if we go to data top stop,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,710
which I mean, so I think it's faster.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,010
Yeah. So we already have this information like LinkedIn,

7
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:33,730
for example, but after the webinar or after events

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,840
or what they usually ask is,

9
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:39,240
uh, any links that, uh,

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,330
she shared during the presentation,

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,260
she over here, but for the speaker, um,

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,520
that should be included in the description activity.

13
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:55,260
It's some blog posts or some tools that speakers mentioned or anything

14
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:59,940
like that. So yeah. Maybe update the template a little bit.

15
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,330
Yeah.
