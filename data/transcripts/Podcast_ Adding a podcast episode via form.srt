1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,020
I short call to schedule a podcast too.

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:07,080
And today we need this core.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,240
Um, so now the episode went live sometime ago.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,520
Yeah. This one with career coaching with Lindsey.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,460
So now I want to create this page.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,390
So with page here and would that,

7
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,790
I need some information. So for each podcast,

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,980
find it links to apple podcasts,

9
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:39,150
Spotify, YouTube, and anchor, and then also transcript.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,310
That's why I created this form. So in this form I

11
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,880
needed a bunch of things. So first of all,

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,170
uh, often this kid will document.

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,960
So here we see.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,450
Yeah, sure. Here we see that this is season seven,

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,230
episode four. So excuse me.

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,910
So on, so forth, then I need to applaud

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,720
the task here. So this is the transcript of how I showed you.

18
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,940
So to download it, if it's a Google doc file,

19
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,590
we need to download it as a doc. It can already be a docs

20
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:28,280
file. Then we don't need to do this. So then done lot,

21
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,210
no clicks. So I have this document here in my download

22
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:38,270
folder. So then I would just attach this well,

23
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,580
uh, yeah, this one

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,290
cool way.

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,460
Um, and then I need to public hero to anchor something darker.

26
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,410
You can get public hero by clicking this three dots and then

27
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,420
copy public link. So then I put it here.

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,300
So we have a staff link. Oops.

29
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,510
Yeah. Well, you can see that it works.

30
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,920
Um, then I need to link to a YouTube video.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,220
So this is the link to YouTube video.

32
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,760
Yeah. We have quite a few questions and then the link they need

33
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,500
this one. So I don't need anything that

34
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,090
all basically only this part that says V equals something.

35
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,970
And then if there is some percent and after the assumption,

36
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,500
I don't need anything

37
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,150
new to Purell, then I need to for podcast hero.

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
So for that to find out the Euro for apple podcast,

39
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,980
I need to here to podcast page and then click on apple podcast.

40
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,250
And then it will bring me to there, to all the podcast

41
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:13,330
episodes or for Theodore squad on apple podcasts.

42
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,320
Then I'm interested in this one. So this one,

43
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,930
it went live today. So I need this thing.

44
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,210
So, all right, click on this  and

45
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:29,680
this to the quorum. Then finally I need Spotify Euro support,

46
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,900
Spotify AGN,

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,660
open this, uh, short here with all the links and

48
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,940
yeah, this one is here, so right

49
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,870
quick doesn't work. So I need to click on this and then copy the

50
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:48,260
Euro

51
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,410
works. Um, and then I submit,

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,230
and then using this information, I will be able to generate,

53
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,430
uh, no to generate,

54
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,160
uh, my pitch.

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,350
I think I forgot one thing. I forgot to

56
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,170
add links. I will probably record

57
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,450
another video with that car, to it that.
