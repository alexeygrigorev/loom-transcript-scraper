00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,660
I saw your, so probably this email from Ellen or

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,800
ask her to move, have a podcast.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,120
And she applied with a date and in the ScaleIO

4
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,700
spreadsheet that would have, oh yeah,

5
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,100
this is not flexible enough to actually,

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,360
um, moving an event to different week.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,350
So what I usually do in this case is a little bit,

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,090
same place. Uh, well, it was supposed to help them and just add this

9
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:38,400
in, uh, this,

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,480
the actual date. So the actual date is March,

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,490
March, and yeah,

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,100
by the way, I ordered the updated invite.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,940
So this one Padma

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,580
replies, maybe it can also be.
