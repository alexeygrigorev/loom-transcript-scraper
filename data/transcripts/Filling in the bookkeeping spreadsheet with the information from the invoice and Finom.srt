1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,120
Yeah. So I wanted to talk a bit about, um,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,070
this thing that you Hilton. So I remember that I sent

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,950
an email, so let me find it. So ,

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,810
uh, I hope the video will actually work so sent,

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,870
so let me check out so many emails. Yeah.

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,950
You there's a lot of works.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,960
Okay. So yeah, so what I did is I sent this email to Dropbox,

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,570
to this email and through books and waste attachment,

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,410
and the subject was sponsorship course.

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,110
Right. And that's why, when we,

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,820
this thing here, it had the date.

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,470
Right. I think I did this today.

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,870
Right. So the thing is because I did it today,

14
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:00,970
it actually, it has the wrong date.

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,670
So first of all, that's, uh, it happened on 30 August,

16
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:09,580
at least the payment. So the payment is,

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,400
uh, this one I paid. So usually when I pay,

18
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:14,170
I do eat on the same day.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,660
That's why, um, yeah,

20
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,290
I don't need to change, but in this case,

21
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,240
um, yeah, we needed to change because I sent them the thing this email

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,630
today, right. The hours ago.

23
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,930
That's why, yeah. The date wasn't correct.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,030
And now let me see,

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,330
what do we have here? Um,

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,510
yeah, so I wanted to also talk about,

27
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:47,170
so this one, the invoice was issued on this date as well yesterday,

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,430
so we can actually check it. It could go to invoices,

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,710
the sponsorship course again,

30
00:01:56,711 --> 00:02:00,040
I think I need to change the date here.

31
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,880
So this is the date when the invoice was paid

32
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,430
and here we see that the invoice was created also on August 13.

33
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,640
So it was created and paid at the same time.

34
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:19,790
So no wonder. So here.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,210
Yeah. I changed it to 13 and then we need here,

36
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,470
um, the provider, right? So they provide their,

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,100
is this

38
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,410
and put here and then a

39
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,570
description is this one and get,

40
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,290
and it's a course, so I'll good at something

41
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,290
like that. Let's say that it's actually a sponsor.

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,510
Of course. I don't think it says,

43
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,880
<v 1>Um, of course I think it's clear and

44
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,090
yeah, that was the total you're depleted.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,510
And that actually,

46
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:17,700
or why, well, why did you put 100?

47
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,750
So no. So this one, so this is the price in,

48
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,770
so this is the transaction, right? So the first thing is the price in

49
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,530
dollars. And then the second is the price in yours.

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,220
So it shouldn't be this month. And even though each of them,

51
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,090
I see where the confusion is coming from. So subtotal is at least one,

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
but it also has like value added tax,

53
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,840
which is, which is 19% in Germany.

54
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,900
So this guy he's in Germany and also in Germany.

55
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,240
And so there is evaluated facts.

56
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,470
Uh, I think, uh, companies from the states have simple as,

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,690
so basically. Yeah. So this is the total,

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,330
the amount I had to pay. Right.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,530
And, uh, yeah.

60
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,230
Then this was the amount in, wait,

61
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,080
your reserve actually, it's more than the Eurozone dollars.

62
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,340
Funny thing. Um, anyway, so this is the amount I had to pay in

63
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:16,710
dollars and this is the amount they have to pay in heroes.

64
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,430
And the tan take care more about Devon and the amount they have to

65
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,920
pay in years, because all they will keep in has to be in euros.

66
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:25,920
And because I'm based in Germany. So yeah,

67
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,770
this is how you, um,

68
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,800
this is how you do this is how you feel.

69
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,480
Uh, this thing that maybe next time it will be easier.
