1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,096
so again for hi again for all the process documents i

2
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:12,666
want at the beginning a description of why

3
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,089
we need this not what the document describes but why we need process documents

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,643
why we need to uhm change uh to add somebody on

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:24,229
the website or like whatever like not just so this is

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,904
how so or what like this describes what contain the document

7
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:33,322
contains but i want to understand when and why uh i want to use

8
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:37,858
this document and all the process documents have to have this i have

9
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,393
mentioned that many times so this is a good starting point but

10
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:46,759
what i actually wanted to see is a document that describes not the process

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,937
document about creating process documents but a document that describes

12
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:56,063
how process documents should be created uhh well i see that this sounds very

13
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:00,589
similar but like more like a template

14
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,764
or like what exactly they should contain not the actions they should- sequence of

15
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:09,329
actions you take to create a process document which is also useful and we

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,865
should keep it but what the process document should contain like in

17
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,950
all the loom videos i sent you previously uhh i don't want to repeat

18
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:22,797
myself like you should go through these videos and listen to what i said

19
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:29,596
and note this down in a document in a google document and

20
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:34,162
we will use this document to understand how our process

21
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:38,729
documents should look like what they should contain what information is important what

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,073
is not important because right now i see that we add a lot of

23
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:46,620
information that is kind of redundant mmm like for example sometimes

24
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:50,305
we have the same thing here the same thing here and then the same

25
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:54,976
thing here at the end and actually like i think we

26
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:59,622
forgot to have a loom video this one doesn't

27
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:03,867
have a loom video so this is fine um but yeah like describes the

28
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,745
structure of the document describes what should be here so

29
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:13,291
so that it should not only describe what the document

30
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:17,817
contains but when to use it and add some examples so then

31
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,854
let's say Feleria wants to create a process document she would open this document

32
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:26,475
and understand what exactly- she needs to do and what kind of content she

33
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:31,251
needs to put in not just take screenshots hmm

34
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:36,107
yeah please start a document and mention all the things I mentioned

35
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:40,092
in the previous rooms if you have to re-watch them re-watch them but like

36
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:44,593
I need to- uhh because I think with this document it

37
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:49,099
will be clearer how our documents will look like so our documentation

38
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,745
will become better and I want to actually

39
00:02:53,746 --> 00:03:02,446
comment this hmm so proceed to loom or like

40
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:08,563
I don't understand what this actually means umm

41
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:13,534
not so sometimes like first you get a loom link

42
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:18,740
from me right and this loom link you receive through telegram

43
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:23,257
or through the to-do list not necessarily the to-do list if I

44
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:26,591
add this to the to-do list it's there but it might be not there

45
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,773
right so if you need to Thank you.

46
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:33,399
to say that to the loom link provided to be directed this is very

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,215
confusing so please still write that um next proceed

48
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:42,981
to datadox google drive and click on the process folder and

49
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:48,404
click on the folder There we go. Umm.

50
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:51,789
We also need a guideline like what kind of categories we have and how

51
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,264
do we select to which category we put.

52
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:59,429
Right? It could be a different document that we link but we need to

53
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,359
have a dista description. So let's say if somebody who does

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,999
not know well this thing, or let's say Valeria wants to play for the

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,719
document, how will she know to which category to put.

56
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:14,199
So we need a description of each category.

57
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,805
In a. . document somewhere. So then you open this description and you see

58
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:25,233
okay this document goes here. Uhh

59
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:27,757
then create a copy of a template.

60
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:34,470
Okay umm.

61
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,596
So the template is already,

62
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:40,882
we need to recreate the template because like if we need to change page

63
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:45,398
setup to make sure that it's pageless then it makes umm means that the

64
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,771
template is uhh not pageless.

65
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:51,831
And we need to rework the template too.

66
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:56,137
So I would suggest that we delete all the templates that you have and

67
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:58,400
create only one in the root in the process.

68
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:03,197
We call it template. And uhh like let me just do

69
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:06,820
it here. We'll create a template.

70
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:18,335
You will start putting the actual content there as uhh

71
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,598
template as you also put the,

72
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:25,344
ehm ehm ehm let me just let me also create it.

73
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:30,111
So this is what I was talking about. Uhh,

74
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:32,715
let's call it process documents,

75
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,800
documents guide.

76
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,624
So I want to create these guidelines.

77
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:44,460
And some things that you mentioned here creating process

78
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:48,866
documents. We can put there. So then if the template is already pageless then

79
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:53,088
we don't need to step. Right? Umm.

80
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,922
Edit. This is.

81
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,986
Yeah, context why we need to do this.

82
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:03,372
Umm.

83
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:08,022
Yeah okay you actually mentioned what uhh like I think the-

84
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:10,315
This is- we should have this at the beginning.

85
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:13,669
So this is not a process document about creating process documents.

86
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,782
It's a document that describes how process documents should look like.

87
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:20,457
So what I have in mind is not a step-by-step thing,

88
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,392
but more like an- some edit.

89
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:27,005
Document uhh that people can read.

90
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:31,332
Not a sequence I have fractions. To understand what a good document should contain.

91
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,377
Just start with something and then we will iterate.

92
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:40,148
And then we can also keep this thing.

93
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,763
Uh, take screenshots and also instead of taking screenshots also

94
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:49,539
sometimes you might need to go to the actual system and instead

95
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,264
of taking screenshots from the video. Take screenshots from that system.

96
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:56,248
Also mention that. Uh.

97
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,560
Ahh.

98
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:07,107
Yeah, this is good. So like,

99
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:10,777
as far as the process document about creating process documents uh,

100
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:14,058
goals. It's- good with a few exceptions,

101
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,731
a few things I mentioned, but this is good.

102
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:19,264
Like, we definitely need to have this document.

103
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:23,199
Just at the beginning I want to uh,

104
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,995
maybe this is how we- we don't need the- Alright, let's

105
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:32,759
do this. Let's remove

106
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,775
that one and just keep this one. Just add more information here and then

107
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:41,312
add step-by-step instructions. So I want to have good

108
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:44,688
examples uh of content.

109
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,078
I want like a description of what a good document contains.

110
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,724
Please re-watch the videos and like everything I mentioned there put

111
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:58,230
in the document in writing. And then when it comes

112
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:00,383
to the template let's have only one template here.

113
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:08,078
I think I should call it process document template so it's not confusing.

114
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,904
And remember I asked you to create an index for templates too.

115
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:14,187
It's still not there. Please do this.

116
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:16,601
Mmm.

117
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:18,617
Okay. Pause that.

118
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,465
Process document.

119
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:27,419
So here we will create a template.

120
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,063
And the reason I add underscore.

121
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,851
So it is the first one. In the.

122
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,975
This list.

123
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,217
And what you do is you make a copy here.

124
00:08:44,218 --> 00:08:46,551
And then you move this copy to.

125
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:50,470
Thank you. One of the folders,

126
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:53,274
right? Let's say we want to move to the air table.

127
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:57,780
So then instead of having templates that could be outdated in each

128
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,953
of the folders, we will.

129
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:02,854
Where is it?

130
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:06,005
Where did it actually go?

131
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,333
Here? Okay,

132
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:15,818
so instead of having this copy of the copy of the copy of the

133
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:19,073
copy, just remove all these copies and let's have.

134
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:22,585
uhh this template,

135
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:27,132
we create a copy of the template and we move the copy of

136
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,557
the template to the process document,

137
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:32,771
to the bread one folder.

138
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:39,561
Mm. Okay,

139
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:43,758
and I assure that all the documents are indexed,

140
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,944
like. Like for example,

141
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:51,700
where's the punctation? Yeah,

142
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:54,946
like. Make sure that all the process documents are in the index,

143
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:58,063
because I see documents that are not in the index,

144
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,543
even though they should be. So make sure that they are there.
