1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,680
I wanted to show you how to create invoices in U s D in

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:08,520
United States dollars. So first we go to our Revolut account and

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:10,760
we copy this, uh, I one,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,760
then we go to here,

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,640
main page, go to documents.

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:22,080
Oh yeah, we don't need to go together documents and just click new document.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,440
Like this is the usual way we create invoices,

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,600
you know, that. And here we select currency,

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,400
not euroes. So usually it's heroes, but here we select US dollars and

10
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:37,840
here we click edit. So we don't change anything except this thing.

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,080
Oh, actually, like we didn't even need to copy.

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,760
So yeah, we can just select that we want to have to use the

13
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,800
account, right? So yeah,

14
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:50,320
you can disregard the first step, uh,

15
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,920
before, so we can just select from the dropdown list.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,360
That's way better, right?

17
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:58,600
And then you just click save, right?

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,170
And that's enough to,

19
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:05,610
and then yeah, you do the rest as usual, but this is how you

20
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,410
can create an invoice in dollars.

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,740
<v 1>Yeah.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,580
And I think next time you create, you might need to change this back.

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,340
Uh, so if invoice is in Euros,

24
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:20,660
so you need to make sure that, um,

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,330
yeah, the here is the main one,

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,810
but if it's not Euros, if it's dollars, then it's uh,

27
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,170
Revolut. Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:32,450
Yeah. And yeah. Yeah,

29
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:34,930
because Phenomen model always remembers the last transaction.

30
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:38,050
So the next time you do, you need to pay attention that it's actually

31
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:42,530
Euros. So be careful about that to not accidentally send something in dollars when

32
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:45,130
it has to be indoors. Uh,

33
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,370
perhaps we need to do, uh,

34
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,770
in our process document is the last step that verifi verify that the currency

35
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:55,180
is correct. And yeah,

36
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,860
perhaps when you finish, uh,

37
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,220
uh, what are you gonna do? Instead of creating a new process document,

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,780
you can update the existing one. And there you can,

39
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,500
uh, mention at the beginning you can mention how you select the currency

40
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:13,540
and how you select the right account, right?

41
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:18,940
And then there's the last step on that process. You add

42
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:22,700
validating that, uh, the currency and the account are correct ones.

43
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,820
So please update the existing process document and send it,

44
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,020
um, for check.
