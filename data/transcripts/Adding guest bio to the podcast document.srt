00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,210
Uh, for podcast events. So as you saw,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,010
Erin sent your view, so this is by MPO is we,

3
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:10,200
don't only at this to profile,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,350
but also, uh, what I usually do is I add this to podcast

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:21,090
documents and it's helpful for me when

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,570
I prepare this documents. When I prepare for the podcast event,

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,590
I know how to introduce the speaker. So that's why I also add this

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,810
to the document.
