1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,960
Um, so I noticed that in a playlist,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,530
if I open, um,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,160
if I open podcast, oh,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,010
we don't have recent. So first of all,

5
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,260
this unspoken relationship is not a podcast.

6
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,870
It's a webinar, so please move it.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,010
And then, uh, the last podcast that we've had here,

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,800
uh, was a podcast.

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:30,060
But after that, we had a podcast event with Ellen and then yesterday,

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,980
they went from yesterday with, um, with one with con Pablo.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,530
So please add them to the playlist,

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,410
you know how to do this. And also,

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,660
you know, just, maybe I'll just remind you.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,310
So this is a,

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,310
not a podcast, it's a webinar. And then,

16
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,430
uh, I usually force team say and them to livestream.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:04,920
And then what you need to do is you need to go through channel.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,460
Let's see, you want me to go through all the latest videos?

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,150
So this one is a webinar, this one,

20
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,550
oh, sorry. This one is a podcast.

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,730
This one is a podcast. This one is a webinars.

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,230
This one is a webinars. Um,

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,420
this one is podcast, please.

24
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,170
Oh, I think this, this one has workshop. It's already in the workshop.

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,620
So you have, let's make sure that these, they are in the correct,

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,680
um, playlists. So that's one thing.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,510
And then the second thing is to make sure we do not forget to

28
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:44,330
do this. What I did is for webinars.

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,650
I added these two,

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,530
these two things, it links from speaker and then at videos.

31
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,980
So first of all, this one, this is what I was talking about.

32
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,190
But then also to make sure that we add links,

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,890
um, after the stream,

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,230
you should write to the speaker and then ask

35
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,080
if they want to share any links and then put them in it,

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,130
in the description. So this is for,

37
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,810
uh, webinars and the same thing for podcast.

38
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,400
So for podcasts, I edit the same two things.

39
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,250
Um, where are they?

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,410
Yeah. These links from the guest.

41
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:37,460
And then we do last thing. So these two things,

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,470
um, so this is what we forgot to do in the last,

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,960
uh, in the, for the last couple of visits.

44
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,380
So now we have this here. Um,

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,220
but I only edit this to the, to the template,

46
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,010
so I don't think it propagates.

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,940
So what I would like to ask you is to do this,

48
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,390
this one, right.

49
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,540
You know, we don't have it here, so please add the same checkpoints to,

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,700
um, all the podcasts, events and webinars to make sure

51
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:15,820
we don't forget this. And yeah,

52
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,340
for these ones, you don't need to a checklist,

53
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:20,470
just make sure you do this or for them,

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,190
I mean, move them to the,

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,120
uh, to the right playlist. Um,

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,180
yeah. And to one other thing, you notice that I added this thing here,

57
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,400
what, because document and Breitling YouTube.

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
So the reason, uh, the way we will use this is one you,

59
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,760
once you have a podcast document. So for example,

60
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:47,080
for, um, for example,

61
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,870
for me, or, uh, yeah, you already add this,

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,270
edit this. Um, but then, um,

63
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,830
we'll also have Encore link. So once we have another Encore link,

64
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,970
you can just edit here and then this way it will be easier for

65
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:05,620
you to share this link then afterwards with the speaker or for example.

66
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,560
Yeah. So this is something that,

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,450
so this is something that we'll do for the next,

68
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,700
uh, and for the next events for both podcasts

69
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,530
and webinars.

70
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,390
Um, yeah, so YouTube as well after this team,

71
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,050
uh, just, uh, uh, let's say this one,

72
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,200
uh, oh, you're ordered to do this.

73
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,720
Cool. Um, so,

74
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,660
well, we don't have it here. We don't have a YouTube,

75
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,250
but then for example, with, um,

76
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,020
like when we have fixed podcast page,

77
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,360
it's easier for you just to, uh,

78
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,950
copied from here and then ask the speaker of the guest

79
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:57,670
to share it with their, within that.

80
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,990
Okay. Yeah. That's what I wanted to show you.

81
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,320
So the main thing is we do not need to,

82
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:09,340
to forget, to put them to play lists and yeah,

83
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,660
it seems like you already got the idea behind these things and you're already

84
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,760
doing this. Um, yeah.

85
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,160
So I guess not need to do anything here.

86
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,390
That's it.
