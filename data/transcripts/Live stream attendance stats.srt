1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,680
Um, hi, I am not sure where this number comes from and this

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:07,320
is not correct. Um,

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,340
but, um, so I want to show you how to actually show how many

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:16,290
people attended the webinars. So you go to the link and

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,190
then here

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,150
And then the X And in analytics,

7
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:31,900
you see how many people actually watched this.

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,520
So I usually take a screenshot of that when people ask me how many

9
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:41,020
people attended the webinars and send it,

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,740
Um, I mean,

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,370
And also the total number, what do you do,

12
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,680
um, Is 19.

13
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,800
So yeah, this is how you get statistics about how many people actually

14
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:36,770
attended, because you were probably sharing,

15
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,550
I'm not sure where this number comes from, but this is quite misleading.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,410
So, yeah.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:47,760
<v 1>Yeah.

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,030
Please don't do that. It's better to like when they ask how many attended

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,180
actually say how many attended,

20
00:01:56,181 --> 00:02:00,650
not stations because many people register,

21
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:03,980
but to not show up. So Yeah,

22
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,930
this is what.
