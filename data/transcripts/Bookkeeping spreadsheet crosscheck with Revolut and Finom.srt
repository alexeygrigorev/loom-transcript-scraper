1
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:05,833
So I wanted to show you how we do this what

2
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:10,056
you what you asked like how we check Revolute and Phenom.

3
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:15,160
So here we have money in the section with money and this is our

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,003
history the transactions right. So we go to the month we want to build

5
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:25,027
a report for and this is July and you look at all the expenses

6
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:30,525
and incomes right. So here we have some incoming transactions

7
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:35,223
and I don't know if we actually have

8
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:37,125
them in the spreadsheet

9
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:42,238
check

10
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:50,213
yeah I think you figured this out right.

11
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:55,387
So first of all um uh

12
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:58,439
the ones that I sent to me,

13
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,934
we don't,

14
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:06,915
no yeah we don't uh include

15
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:13,080
so this one please remove them all

16
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:16,223
right so this uh TK, Technicare Krankenkasse,

17
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:21,167
this is my uh health insurance so this should go to this

18
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:24,620
thing so let's uh move it

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,484
so this Community Launch, I'll just call it Alex um

20
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:41,037
it's not OpenAI Invoice, it's OpenAI so the correct spelling

21
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:45,500
is um yeah so Valeria,

22
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,562
Phenome, Phenome, Phi, Phenome Sound,

23
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:52,425
also make sure that the minus sign is correct here so

24
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:57,168
right now here what we have is uh um not a minus but

25
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:00,730
like I don't know.

26
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:05,573
Dash or whatever so it has to be proper minus and then for Valeria

27
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:10,737
I think am I looking at the last month yeah this

28
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:18,242
one zero then

29
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:20,723
OpenAI should be OpenAI,

30
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:25,687
AI Usage um so

31
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:29,249
yeah and then like for each of these records So we should have an

32
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:37,124
invoice, right? So I think you already figured it out um

33
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:41,738
I cannot just so as I said it always has to be

34
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:51,834
minus like that and then uh

35
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:56,908
yeah like that so yeah make sure that the

36
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:01,560
formatting is always like it treats it as a digit so here instead

37
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:06,240
of comma you use I am right now a bit confused

38
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:11,280
with what you did and what you did not do here so

39
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:17,040
again records this is when I sent money to me it

40
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:21,920
shouldn't be included so replace

41
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:26,980
all the minuses all the commas with dots and

42
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,720
when a comma is here you don't you remove foot.

43
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,753
1 so here remove dot here remove

44
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:40,377
zeros dot here and yeah either remove zeros or just

45
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:46,302
put a dot there so it has to be like American formatting

46
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:51,986
so this one uh their name is

47
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,859
like where does it actually come from? Like 7-3?

48
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,112
Do you take it from here or?

49
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,773
Okay, I don't understand.

50
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:08,395
Okay, yeah,

51
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:09,256
right, so they

52
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:22,424
create invoice. Okay.

53
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,949
So you remove,

54
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,231
you don't include this. This one. And make sure that for each of these

55
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:36,292
records, we have a,

56
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:42,754
we have a document, we have a PDF. So this one,

57
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,345
I think their right name is like, you need to find,

58
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:56,679
um, incoming

59
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,140
voices. Yeah,

60
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:02,951
like you need to, you put what, why,

61
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,353
what is actually here. So for Southern Cloud,

62
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:08,315
like when you find the invoice, you will find what it is for.

63
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:11,978
So you need to add here. So this is consulting.

64
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,180
This is actually taxes.

65
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,691
So here you put, uh,

66
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,243
taxes, uh, July,

67
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,605
July. Now yeah,

68
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,146
you can always look at the previous months, right?

69
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:30,920
and Southern Cloud, yeah, you also write.

70
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:33,402
What for you will find it in the invoices,

71
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:35,653
uh, Google Workspace,

72
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:40,566
Cloud. Um,

73
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,278
do we have an invoice? There, there should be a process document for finding

74
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,951
the invoice from Meetup. Uh, virtual assistant,

75
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:51,544
um, business launch. If I use

76
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:54,666
community launch. Yeah,

77
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:59,169
this looks correct. So this Cambridge Mercantile Corporation

78
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:04,322
should be, should actually be here. Be, um,

79
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,184
Arise Inc. They just use,

80
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:10,797
uh, some sort of proxy for which they pay.

81
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:13,198
So the invoice was sent to Arise.

82
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:19,062
So we need to rename it to Arise.

83
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:21,324
Where is Arise?

84
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:26,407
Can't find them. Arise.

85
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:31,630
Yeah. So this is Arise AI. And

86
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,472
then check the, using the invoice number,

87
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:39,285
what it was actually for. Right. Uh,

88
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:44,039
so here again should be dot. So now we can check that everything

89
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:47,601
works. If we can look at this, if we select everything and we see

90
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:49,822
the sum. Right. So something is still wrong.

91
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,386
So this one is wrong. All right,

92
00:06:54,406 --> 00:07:01,060
so now when we select, something is still not correct.

93
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:05,332
Ah, here, the sum.

94
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:15,739
So I don't know what this R is.

95
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,212
So you need to fill this in and this in too.

96
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:23,084
Uh, and

97
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,459
like these ones are needed to,

98
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,932
um, be able to. To know how many documents should be in the zip

99
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:36,283
file that we sent. So usually this one,

100
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:40,896
uh, we don't include invoices from our accountants.

101
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:44,779
So this, uh, uh, is consulting is our accountants.

102
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,341
So we don't send our accounts, accountants,

103
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:50,803
the invoices from our accountants. The rest of the invoices we sent.

104
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,645
So then it's all ones here.

105
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,629
Right. And then I just look at the number of ones here.

106
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,820
and I see that's okay. There should be 20 invoices.

107
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,300
And when we prepare the zip archive, we need to make sure.

108
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,640
So for example, this is for the previous month,

109
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:15,020
right? So there are 12 invoices. And I can check in

110
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:19,860
this folder that there are also 12 files,

111
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,600
right? So this, this much, uh,

112
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,680
these two numbers much, right? So we want to have the same.

113
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,420
So we want to make sure that we sent all the invoices to our

114
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:32,391
accountants. and then for Finansamt,

115
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:36,003
we'll put it here. So please put it in the same,

116
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:39,115
uh, format as here. And

117
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,681
to know what it is for, you can go to Finom. Yeah.

118
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:52,394
And then, um,

119
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:54,565
this is the thing we need to put here.

120
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:58,938
So this should be something.

121
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,233
Something like this. Yeah,

122
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,616
right. And then the same with Tekka.

123
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:23,525
So, so this here,

124
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:26,087
this Tekka and Finansamt are that access.

125
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,942
Yeah. So you need to fill this in for incoming

126
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:37,023
invoices. And I think you figured this out,

127
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:42,087
right? So how do you go through all the payments

128
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,188
here? And the same with Revolut.

129
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:52,254
Come on. Well,

130
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:54,695
it's basically the same and I think you figured it out.

131
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:58,798
So like there's an overview of all the transactions and you go through them

132
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:03,472
and see if any of the incoming transactions or outcoming transactions are missing.

133
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:08,777
And if they are, you make sure you add invoice to the Dropbox folder.

134
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,900
Okay, this was a long video. I hope it was useful.

135
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:16,304
So let me know if you have any questions and let's please document everything

136
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:20,308
that is not documented yet. So then it's way clearer,

137
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:22,620
let's say, when we want to onboard a new person.
