1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,250
Hi. I want to show you one more thing,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,910
but before I do this, so I want to talk about this open source

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,980
spotlighting. But before I do this,

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:14,610
I want to give you a quick recap of what we have so far,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,380
what we've discussed so far, because I understand this may be causing

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,890
a lot of confusions, so have a lot of different activities.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,970
So we have weekly life events. So this events that happen every week,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,140
that I've ever been those events with slides that we have on Tuesdays.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,780
And we have flap interviews on Fridays.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,940
I already show it to you and these things.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,630
And then we have book off the week thing. This is where in white

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,520
book authors in slack. So the event is kinda it's happening in slack.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,680
Um, people ask questions in slack and then podcast is when we

14
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,420
record live in through use and take these interviews and release

15
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:59,010
them as audio only versions. You probably remember this page podcast

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,780
on the, on our website. And then the other thing I haven't talked about

17
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:08,280
is this open source spotlight. So if we go to our YouTube channel,

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,650
one of the playlist, there we go to playlist to one of the playlist.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,720
There is this open source spotlight spotlighting.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,140
So there are quite a few different things there.

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,450
So this are, uh, we invite authors of different open source libraries

22
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,630
to give a talk, uh, to give a presentation about Dave,

23
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,460
to, for example, the environment running on AWS

24
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:32,600
or .

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,220
Um, yeah, and now I recently had one

26
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:44,250
of the authors also who presented their tool.

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,850
And now I want to upload this to YouTube and I want to show

28
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:51,750
you that. So I have it somewhere.

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,440
Yeah. So we use zoom for recording.

30
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,840
So you see this link. So probably after this recording is done,

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,570
I will forward to you such a link. So you will have a link

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,340
also with passcode. So let me open it in incognito.

33
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:13,200
So you see how to look for you. So I

34
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:17,460
will copy the link and then it will ask for password.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,420
So now I need to copy this password.

36
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,960
Yes. Except cookies.

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,760
And then we have this recording. So this is the demo

38
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:35,790
that, uh, uh, our own gave.

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,970
So now I am going to click on download.

40
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,470
So it is being saved right now. Um,

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,750
he is saving a lot of things.

42
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,400
We only need one. So now I don't

43
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:53,940
know which of them. So let me wait till everything downloads.

44
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,530
I will, uh, open them folder.

45
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,810
So yeah, there are two things. So one is gallery and then just one,

46
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,370
the other one is just recording. So gallery is when we have you see,

47
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,220
it's like phase by phase or like say by site.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,210
So me on one side and then on the other side,

49
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,040
and there's just a,

50
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,440
where it's you see, it's not side by side.

51
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,710
I have those insights. Um,

52
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,750
so we are interested in this. Oops.

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,800
I don't know why it doing that.

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,680
So on one account, my, as my account,

55
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,170
it's not doing this gallery thing on another.

56
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:41,650
It is doing this, but we're interested in this thing.

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,810
So now I go to YouTube and then on YouTube,

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,230
there is this create and to make sure that you are in Datadog's club

59
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,410
account. So I click upload video lead

60
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:01,000
brings me to the studio and now I just drag and drop it.

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,730
So now it starts uploading. Now I need to give it a name.

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,520
So the name should be, uh,

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,800
let me open, uh,

64
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,740
other, uh, other events in this,

65
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,950
uh, open source spotlight. You will see the pattern.

66
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,260
So the pattern is open source spotlight when dash the name of the tube

67
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:25,390
and dash the name of the presenter.

68
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,450
So it is open source book,

69
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,780
LOTE, and dash the name of the tool.

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,960
Now what's the name of the tool it's cast lit.

71
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,660
Yeah. Cool way. Um,

72
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,620
let me into this nuttin Castile IO.

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,360
Yeah. This one. So this has the name of the tool cost,

74
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,410
uh, cost lit.

75
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,660
And then the name of this person.

76
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:10,060
Let me check. Uh,

77
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:19,060
yeah, so this is his name. So let me copy it and

78
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:23,410
paste it here. And now we need to give a,

79
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,070
some description. So usually it falls this way,

80
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,250
uh, that this formats months first the name of the two,

81
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,130
then a colon, and then,

82
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,570
um, some description of the tool,

83
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,860
what the tool was doing. So thinking get happy.

84
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:44,560
Usually they have this one liner. Uh,

85
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,540
so this is open source solution or diversity of solution

86
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,670
that helps you periodically sync the data.

87
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,470
Um, now let me just take that.

88
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,650
Yeah. Uh,

89
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,310
sort of CTL solution, uh,

90
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,160
Yeah, that's a long description, but the key who can live it like that,

91
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,250
and then we have some links.

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,680
So this links, uh, ask, uh,

93
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,890
ask their guest, Jay usually should ask the

94
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,920
guest, Hey, what are the links you want to include? And they sent me

95
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,640
the links. Usually it's the link to get her page.

96
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,620
So let me conclude it right away up.

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,480
And then yeah, ask the, I guess first, and then here will be time

98
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:43,850
codes, time codes.

99
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,220
Uh, yeah, so basically,

100
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,880
uh, you know, what 10 codes are, and this is something I also ask

101
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,000
the guest to provide.

102
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,980
Um, yeah, you see it actually already is uploaded right now.

103
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:00,410
I do not select any playlist. This will,

104
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,660
I will do all the activity end,

105
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,270
but, uh, the playlist will be open source spotlight.

106
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,420
I do not select it right now, monetization.

107
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,980
Or then I go to  because

108
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,530
ads are quite annoying. And then this isn't listed,

109
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,780
this isn't listed because they want the author to the guests

110
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,780
to be able to review it. So I click save and

111
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,940
then let me copy the link.

112
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,970
So get shareable link.

113
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,070
So now it is copied to clipboard.

114
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,290
Now we'll copy it here.

115
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,470
And, uh, what I want to do now,

116
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,750
I don't know if it's a possible right now.

117
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,660
Uh, maybe it is not yet possible.

118
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,310
I actually am lucky. It is usually it takes a bit of time before

119
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,150
the edit. Uh, now option is available.

120
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,570
Maybe this video was quite small. Um,

121
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,340
so I'll show it right away. Usually what I do is

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,270
no. Hello. Hi Lexi. Yeah.

123
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,100
Can you tell us if you want, uh where's I need to trim,

124
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,280
so, and then in 3m, I want to remove silence

125
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,030
at the beginning.

126
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,830
So silence at the beginning. Now I click preview to check.

127
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,420
No. Hello. So little bit more.

128
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,370
Yeah. Can you tell us a few words about yourself and about the tool

129
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:45,280
you want to show us? Sure. Yeah,

130
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,930
that is okay. Maybe actually to start with hello?

131
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,410
No. Hello. I want to enlarge it to leave a bit.

132
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,240
Oh

133
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,500
yeah. I like that. Hello? Hi Lexi.

134
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,940
Yeah. Can you tell us a few words about yourself and about the two

135
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:16,410
of you? Okay. So that we remove this from the beginning,

136
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,350
and then I also want to make sure that at the end,

137
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,660
there is also no silence.

138
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,780
Yep. Bye bye everyone. Bye.

139
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,490
So yeah, we don't need this bit at the end as well.

140
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,970
That's usually all I need to remove.

141
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,390
Sometimes maybe there is something in the middle in this one.

142
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,670
We do not need to remove anything from the middle.

143
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:46,680
So I click preview and now I click save paid

144
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:48,960
will take some time to upload, but,

145
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:52,230
uh, I ordered you not to upload to update.

146
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,110
I already have a link. So once these link,

147
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,180
once the video is updated, I will send this to the guests.

148
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,420
Um, so I usually do this from my work account because in my

149
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:08,820
work account, they have a zoom that,

150
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,330
uh, uh, that is better basically.

151
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,640
So it is more expensive, but at work,

152
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,250
uh, I can use it for, for these things as well.

153
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,950
Um, oh, actually, you see, I run already provided the links.

154
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,350
So let me just go ahead and put them, I don't need this anymore,

155
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,140
so, and not what

156
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,990
they wanted. Yeah.

157
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:41,100
This one. So in details links.

158
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,470
So we already asked the guest for links.

159
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,380
He already sent, so we don't need,

160
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,230
I can get her because I already did edit this.

161
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,990
Okay. Click save. And now this link,

162
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,880
copy this link and send it to the guest.

163
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,860
And, uh, I, I don't,

164
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,970
uh, because for me took a bit of time to process this.

165
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going to say, sorry.

166
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,450
Apologies for the delay.

167
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,090
Um, here is that we do,

168
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,670
uh, please, uh, sent me that time.

169
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,460
What's oh,

170
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,220
maybe I should be a bit more polite and say,

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,000
thanks again for presenting,

172
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,150

00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:48,120
me the time cones. Good time. Cause when you have time,

175
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,980
um, yeah, have a great week. Something like this.

176
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,480
I will probably add you as well. So let me copy your

177
00:11:58,481 --> 00:11:59,020
email.

178
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,930
I will copy your email as well.

179
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,840
<v 1>Yeah.

180
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,770
Um, yeah, so let's all.

181
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,300
And because it takes a bit of time to update,

182
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,400
uh, for YouTube to update it.

183
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,650
So what I will do is I will click here,

184
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,930
let me check a usual Gaetan g-mail has it.

185
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,680
So if I click reply, the usual Jamail also has it.

186
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,500
So, um,

187
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,960
so here are the skid schedule sent.

188
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,630
So I do schedule time,

189
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,650
um, peak date and time.

190
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,650
So right now for me, it's 5:00 PM.

191
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,800
So what I'll do is I will send it at,

192
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,800
uh, let's say tomorrow,

193
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,950
uh, I think he's in India. Um,

194
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,740
so tomorrow maybe, um,

195
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,710
6:00 AM we're mourning for him.

196
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,090
Um, so yeah, by tomorrow I am sure.

197
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,320
Uh, it will be ready. Okay.

198
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,810
Yeah. Skillset.

199
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,640
Yeah. You don't have to do this for tomorrow.

200
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,950
You don't need to know where they are. Exactly.

201
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,190
This is just a thought that if I send it right now,

202
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,790
uh, in two hours it will be like midnight for him,

203
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,260
even a middle of the night. So I hope of course he's notifications are

204
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:38,170
turned off just in case I did this for morning.

205
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,440
So then in the morning he will see this, uh,

206
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,380
he will check this. He will reply with,

207
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,460
uh, time codes. And then I think there is a lot of the video

208
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,830
that shows how to add time coats.

209
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,840
So once he sends them, you will just need to place

210
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,630
them here. Okay.

211
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,890
That's all I wanted to show you.
