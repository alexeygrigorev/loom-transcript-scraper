1
00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:04,163
So I wanted to comment on remove the small talk.

2
00:00:04,164 --> 00:00:07,045
So usually when we start five minutes before the event,

3
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:13,829
there is some conversation going on. But this conversation is not useful for

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,211
the audience. That's why we keep it. So at some point,

5
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:20,494
I start sharing the screen and say Hi everyone,

6
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:23,896
welcome to our event. This event is brought to you by DataDogsClub,

7
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:26,217
which is a community of people who love data.

8
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:30,640
Basically, you need to find this thing when they share this screen and then

9
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,560
when I say that, like, Hi, this event is brought to you by DataDogsClub,

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,900
and you cut everything before that.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,540
Uh, sometimes very infrequently,

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,020
occasionally, I might not say these words,

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,460
I might not share the screen. Then you will need to use your judgment

14
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:49,740
to find the place when the talk actually starts,

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,440
you can always confirm with me, but in 99% of the cases,

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,620
Hi everyone, The events start with that,

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,470
at least podcasts, episodes, and webinars.

18
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:05,013
Workshops, and course videos are a little bit different,

19
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,095
so then you will learn this,

20
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:12,658
and then probably we should keep a document where we write how exactly

21
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:16,060
you determine whether the event started or not,

22
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,873
and if before was a small talk, um,

23
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:23,666
so please create a document for that. So for this particular event,

24
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:26,928
we don't need to do anything because it has been edited already.

25
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:32,056
For new ones, you will need to do this so we will have one

26
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:35,145
next week, right, with Rachel, so then you will need to do that.

27
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,560
For this one, it's already good.
