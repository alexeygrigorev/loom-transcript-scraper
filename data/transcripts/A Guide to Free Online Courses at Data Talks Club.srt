1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,505
uh so we have this new article by Valeria,

2
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:09,401
a guide to free online courses. And here we have this table

3
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:12,005
with information about the courses, right?

4
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:16,516
And here in particular what is interesting right now is the starting date

5
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:20,047
of the next cohort, which quite,

6
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,134
which changes over time,

7
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:24,954
right? And I now noticed a mistake here,

8
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:27,605
so I wanted to fix it, and I also wanted to show you how

9
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:29,905
to change it later,

10
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:32,262
let's say when we run this course.

11
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:34,580
For the next time, this course, this course,

12
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:37,661
and so on. So we wouldn't, we would need to change it,

13
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:42,280
so I want to show it how to find it, so for that we

14
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:45,785
need, we go to our repo,

15
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:48,667
website repository, we go to Boston.

16
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:53,141
And we go to this article,

17
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:55,497
so this is the, this article,

18
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:58,263
Guide to Free Online Courses at Data Talks Club.

19
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,338
All right, and you probably know,

20
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:03,939
we click edit, and this course.

21
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:06,597
mess is the table that we saw.

22
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:11,877
So what we need to find here is this,

23
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:14,637
this is what we want to change, Machine Learning Zoom Camp,

24
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:17,957
and we need to update it. Actually,

25
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:20,809
it was right, it was September 2024. Of course,

26
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,829
this is now 2024, um so actually I don't need to change

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,909
it, but uh yeah,

28
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:31,589
yeah, so this was right, but now you know how to,

29
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,489
if we needed to change it here to 2025,

30
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:38,084
this is how we do this. And then we click and it changes,

31
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:40,251
right. And my mistake,

32
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:42,267
uh yeah, we don't need to change it,

33
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:47,053
but yeah, so this is how we update the,

34
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:48,152
this article.
