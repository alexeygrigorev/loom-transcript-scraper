1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,540
Already talked about book of the week. So now I want to show you

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:06,630
how you can add books and authors.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,240
Um, I have a special form for that. Um,

4
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:15,210
so the first forum was called people. So let me click open

5
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:17,850
forum. So I sent you this link,

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,910
so you will be using this link to add people,

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,480
uh, to this form. And then I will have on my side,

8
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:28,500
a script that pulls data from there and then publishes this to the website.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,340
Um, so this is the link. I will send you this link.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,100
So now we want to create a personal profile on a data,

11
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:40,980
talks, a club webpage. So in this particular case,

12
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,950
it will be an author. Um, but the same process,

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,540
uh, the process is the same for other people like for podcast

14
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:53,160
guests, for webinars, guests, and so on. So in this particular case,

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
the author is Miller.

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,950
I hope I pronounce his name correctly, so we need his email.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,660
So this will be like, uh, a key that uniquely identifies this person because

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,930
they might have the, maybe there are two people with the same name.

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,260
And since we have email, we can uniquely identify them.

20
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,910
Then we need his name.

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,050
So the name is this one.

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,470
Um, then we need his . So one thing you

23
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,660
can ask, uh, usually for speakers,

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,790
I asked them, Hey, can you send me your view?

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,080
Um, but because Mayer is a book author, we have a link to his

26
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:37,200
book and usually on books,

27
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,350
uh, there is, uh, a description about the author.

28
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,990
Um, so where,

29
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,850
yeah, so about the author. So

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,910
I will just copy that. Uh,

31
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:58,620
of course he's my journey. Maybe we can ask him to provide

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,600
better, um, viewer and

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,290
yeah, of course each book page has a different layout,

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,570
so it's not always here. So for example,

35
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,940
if we go to mining,

36
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,300
so my, for mining, this is another book publisher,

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,270
the information, uh, let me take, for example,

38
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,310
this one. Um,

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,410
so here the information about the book,

40
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,290
sorry, here about the author.

41
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,330
So this is what he usually copy.

42
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,350
So for mining is in one place for O'Reilly it's in a different place,

43
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,580
but, uh, yeah, if you have problems finding the audio book,

44
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:39,540
authors, tell me in any case,

45
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:44,460
you can always ask them and you will need to do that for people

46
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:48,270
who are not book authors. So let me copy that.

47
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,500
So I am copying it here the other few.

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,470
Then we have two fields for pictures.

49
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,440
So there are two ways of uploading a picture.

50
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,870
So we'll show you the easy way.

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,930
So we can just,

52
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,940
uh, if the author agrees,

53
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,370
we can just go to their LinkedIn page and then click

54
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:16,360
one, click on the picture and then right.

55
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:21,100
Click, um, and then copy in which address and what happens is you get

56
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:25,420
an address that is copied to your clipboard,

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,450
and then this is the image. Um,

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,370
you can save it or you can put

59
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:33,920
it there.

60
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,980
I think you can just do that now.

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,770
So it should be either this or this.

62
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,580
Uh, I will show you how to also do it without with uploading.

63
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,600
So this is pretty simple. Um,

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,740
so this is the, I think we just uploaded so I can do that.

65
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,100
I click upload and then if I was there,

66
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,240
um, but yeah, it wouldn't be a picture Euro.

67
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,670
So if you provide both, so first, uh,

68
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,120
the first day we'll check if pictures there, if the picture is there,

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,820
I will use this. If the picture is not there,

70
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,610
I will ups. I will use the link.

71
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,480
So, okay. I think here let's go with a link and

72
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:23,380
then we need to fuel some links for this,

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,550
uh, for the speaker. So we need to get cup LinkedIn profile Twitter and

74
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:31,900
the website. The best thing you can do is just ask the author.

75
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,180
Um, or what I sometimes do is a,

76
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,750
just use Google. So for example,

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,630
I go to Google, right? First name, last name,

78
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,690
and then get up. And then,

79
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,310
yeah, it doesn't seem like , has they get help?

80
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,310
They say don't Google it. Doesn't find it.

81
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,980
Maybe we can just ask him.

82
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,740
No, I will not do this.

83
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,250
Uh, um, I will just move on.

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,790
So if you don't find anything, leave it empty,

85
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,140
then LinkedIn, I already have his LinkedIn name.

86
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,530
So it should be this part here.

87
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,150
Right? So not the whole URL, but just the handle then Teeter,

88
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,070
I don't know if he has Twitter, just use Google.

89
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,080
Yeah. Things like he has. Uh,

90
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,780
don't think this is the right purse.

91
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,510
Um, alright,

92
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:41,380
let me check. So at the least,

93
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:44,800
yeah. So you see the picture. It's very easy to see,

94
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,590
um, like if this is the same person,

95
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:52,510
because you see the picture, so I'm taking this thing after

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,180
hit or yeah. They can take it from the hero.

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,610
Um, and then the website, actually,

98
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:04,340
I don't know what his website is. I guess we can also ask him

99
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,040
if he goes to any website or not.

100
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,180
I think his website is these key dimensions.

101
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,020
Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:24,350
And this is his website and it, um,

103
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,100
so I submit,

104
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,830
okay, now I have this information.

105
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,890
So you will not have access. Maybe you will have access.

106
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,290
Uh, I don't know how to actually organize this,

107
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,980
but yeah, in this forum now I see this.

108
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,780
So all the data that you just submitted it's here and what you don't

109
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:48,410
see you the status. And then this is what they will use to,

110
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,380
uh, see the backup in different view to add.

111
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,590
So these are all the people who are not added.

112
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,210
And once I add them, the status will change to done

113
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,550
right now. It's up to you. So this is how you add authors to

114
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,620
this form. And then using this form,

115
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,960
I will create a page on the website.
