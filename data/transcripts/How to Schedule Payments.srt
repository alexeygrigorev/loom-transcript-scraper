1
00:00:01,026 --> 00:00:05,273
I just wanted to show you how to schedule payments.

2
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:10,056
So we have usual payments but some payments are occurring and for example

3
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:13,304
this one that we got from our accountants.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,936
So they ask for monthly

5
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:20,109
payment of this amount,

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,826
right? So they say from this day to this

7
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:28,100
day we have already paid the first one.

8
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:32,377
So I want to show you how we can schedule at that That,

9
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:34,520
Infinum. So Infinum,

10
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:39,867
because we already paid umm.

11
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:45,814
So we already paid umm for January so there is no need to

12
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:48,553
do January anymore. So we start from February.

13
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:50,866
I first of all, yeah, I fill it in.

14
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:56,072
Then I click here schedule and make it regular and frequency is monthly

15
00:00:56,073 --> 00:01:00,658
and then start date is first of February and date is

16
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,798
end of December. And they say the payment will be made every month until

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,898
blah blah blah included the starting from February 1.

18
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:10,178
This is 11 times so this is exactly what we need.

19
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:15,618
Out of 12 we paid once so we need 11 and

20
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:20,472
yeah and the reason for payment as usual is

21
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,825
the invoice number right.

22
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:29,874
So now I can just click continue and click schedule and

23
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:35,171
then now I confirm it. Confirm

24
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:38,457
and now it is scheduled.

25
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:42,272
So I don't think it will happen often but at least in one year

26
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:46,187
when they sent an invoice. We want you to do this and I'll just

27
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:50,884
forward you this email. Google is quite good at translating

28
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:55,906
German but I think it's more or less clear what's happening here.

29
00:01:55,907 --> 00:02:00,553
Yeah we already have here in our

30
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,707
uhh address book.

31
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:08,712
So yeah. Okay that's how we

32
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:11,442
schedule regular payments.

33
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:12,182
Thanks for watching!
