1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,580
I wanted to show you how to link, uh, payment to an invoice.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,500
So this is the invoice that, uh,

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,900
is overdue. So, cause there is no,

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,060
uh, we didn't manage to automatically link,

5
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:17,580
they didn't, uh, put the invoice number in the note,

6
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:21,100
I guess anyways. So here we just click at payment

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,820
and then there is this one, this

8
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:40,390
one, and I

9
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:43,470
think now should just mark everything as

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,880
is wrong with my internet, I guess. So lemme do

11
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:10,610
it one more time. Okay.

12
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,930
Now its linked. And now if I go back to,

13
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,990
yeah, it's from here. Yeah,

14
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:23,190
you did send this. I asked you in,

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,710
uh,

16
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,140
okay.
