1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
So I want to show you how I reach to reach out to people

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:08,130
about podcasts. So LAN uh,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,020
I contacted her recently. I introduced myself and then I asked,

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,450
would you be interested in being a podcast guest?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,170
And then I also say that, uh, somebody else,

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,040
uh, nor the mill recommended that I reach out to her.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,240
Um, so yeah, if, um, if not that,

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,600
maybe I, would I meet that and just say that I'm Alexia from Datadog

9
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:34,140
spark and this one. Um,

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,590
and then yeah, she replies. Yes. And I already propose

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,190
a topic here, uh,

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,540
where this I,

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,790
uh, I said, no, I recommended, uh,

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,560
and I'd be quite interested to talk about your experience of transitioning from data

15
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:55,470
science to data engineering. So I already proposed the topic.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,100
Um, sometimes when, I don't know what topic is,

17
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,550
I just want this guest to this person to be a guest.

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,510
I just reach out without proposing the topic. And then we to get to

19
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,960
agree on a topic. So here I already proposed the topic and then she

20
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,510
agreed. She said that she'd be happy.

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,140
And then what I want to do now is I say,

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,570
um, I do

23
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,150

00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,220
uh, a date. So the next available date is 25th

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,130
