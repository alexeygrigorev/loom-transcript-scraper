1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,480
<affirmative>. Um, yeah. So you saw that,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,000
uh, perfect. Paid partially. I don't know.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,480
For some reasons it's always a problem with them.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,080
Like we probably need to make invoices,

5
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:13,360
uh, send them invoice and dollars so it's easier.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,520
Um, because what we need to do now is either ask them to pay

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,200
500 more, but then it'll always be problems with converting currencies.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,480
So what we can do is we can just take this number mm,

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,490
and edit this. So we need to put

10
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,530
here this value

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:39,410
<v 1><affirmative>.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,680
All right. And then, uh, here,

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,160
wait, this one. But what we also need to do,

14
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:51,240
so now it's fully paid, uh,

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,080
download PDF and send them, uh, send this to perfect saying that,

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,440
uh, okay, because of the currency conversion,

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,560
uh, we received only this amount.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,800
And to understand that it's a bit of hassle to ask you four or

19
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:09,320
500 more. So what we do instead is we create an invoice on this

20
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,620
number, uh,

21
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,820
right now. And, um,

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,980
this is what we'll use in our tax report.

23
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,020
And if you need, this is the something you can use in your report.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,500
And for the next one, you can also write,

25
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,220
uh, that the next one we will, uh,

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,670
uh, let me think. So the next one we will issue in,

27
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:36,190
uh, esd. So for them it's simpler.

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,550
So we will do the conversion or on our side and instead of,

29
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:44,310
uh, creating invoice for 15,000 euros.

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,950
So we'll do the conversion. We'll send them an amount in dollars that

31
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:51,390
they will need to send to us. And then,

32
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,950
yeah, we'll figure this out on our side.

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,390
Okay, that's, uh, all I wanted to,

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,950
to say. So perhaps what you can do right now is create

35
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:05,110
a process document describing how to,

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,150
um, retroactively edit the,

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,910
um, the invoices.

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,350
Then you will need to update the invoice that we have here before

39
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,110
you send the report. So, and then it'll be not partially paid,

40
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,750
but paid. Um,

41
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,350
so it'll in be included on our February report.

42
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,790
And, um, yeah.

43
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,150
Here.

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,390
What else? And yeah,

45
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,550
please write an email, uh,

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,590
to perfect explaining what, what happened. That's all.
