00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,850
Hmm. I want to show you how to use Email

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,770
in LinkedIn. InMail is a

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,650
different way of reaching out through LinkedIn,

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,550
LinkedIn. So for example, let's Say

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,130
Katrina, for example, I wanted to,

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,950
oh yeah. So I just got Catherine here.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,560
So we still a, you sent a connection request from my account

8
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:38,520
as well. What she still have to apply it. So in this case say,

9
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:40,650
you see there's this message button,

10
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:45,630
right? So it's because I have a premium account on LinkedIn.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,750
I can actually write to people I am not connected with.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,120
So for some people, because it's funky five Peer

13
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,700
month, um, because of that,

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,330
we need to be careful when using them. So we'll kind of just use

15
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,030
it for everyone, but for Catherine,

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,530
maybe she just doesn't visit LinkedIn very often,

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,890
but this thing will go straight to your email.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,710
So You can just write

19
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:23,010
here using this email, Um,

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,280
April.

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,410
So this can be the topic And we

22
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,300
open the template. You have a template for

23
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,990
When it's, Um,

24
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,400
Is this,

25
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,100
The name is very misleading. Please change it to something like,

26
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,070
first of all, there are two templates change that.

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,080
Um,

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,810
Okay.

29
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,480
So yes,

30
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:48,730
here actually we can be quite there most,

31
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,960
maybe we can,

32
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,320
Uh, say,

33
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,130
And then I will copy these because there is quite some information already,

34
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,060
Maybe,

35
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,610
Uh, community it's like,

36
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,000
All right. So we need to mention that as well.

37
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,290
Uh huh.

38
00:03:59,430 --> 00:03:59,730
Oh,

39
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,580
Um,

40
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,520
Um, here, I'll also say that

41
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,160
Um, so this will be optional if Say,

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,940
And this will be well

43
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,830
Community, if your own name recommended reaching out to you,

44
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:03,080

45
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,870

<v 1>Taking

54
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,440
My information? I was wondering if you get the, I

55

think it's kind of repetitive CJ recommended to you or would they be

56
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:31,880
<v 1>Yeah.

57
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,850
Yeah. Okay. And now I just click send,

58
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,900
So, yep. This is how you use emails.

59
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,970
And remember I have only limited number of emails,

60
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,080
so I don't use it on everyone.

61
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,490
I'll probably just send to you.  using emails.
