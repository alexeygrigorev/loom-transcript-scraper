1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,710
Okay. Another thing I wanted to show you, um,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,630
is, uh, companies who sponsor conferences.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,190
So typically if a company is sponsoring a conference,

4
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:12,030
then they might also consider a sponsor in our community.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,470
So there is a conference called Data Natives and they have a bunch of

6
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:18,670
sponsors. And for this,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,990
uh, oops. Um,

8
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,150
so they have a page, special page with, uh,

9
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:24,190
sponsors Go

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:24,390
<v 1>Away.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,710
I come back. Okay. Um,

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,430
so they have some sponsors here,

13
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,270
right? Um, Diamond Partners,

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,230
uh, whatever. And uh,

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,800
yeah, so I wanted to get some of them that are relevant for us.

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,540
So for example, uh,

17
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,180
I don't know, quick maybe is relevant.

18
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,340
So we can, uh, let's add them.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,200
So I will just go and add here.

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,080
Date, uh, natives 2002 conference.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,610
So here Link would be, I don't know,

22
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:10,530
just this one. This one.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,810
Then, uh, so that's product service.

24
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:17,970
They are, yeah,

25
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,210
it's actually, I have confidence sponsorship, right?

26
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:22,370
A special, like a separate category for this.

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,250
And then, so this one, Data natives was an offline event.

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,330
So the category, category is confidence event offline.

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,410
Then relevance is, um,

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,690
I don't know if they're super relevant. Um,

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,250
I think if something is high relevant, uh,

32
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:41,450
relevancy, then I will edit here is high.

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,890
Okay. And then the company I wanted to add is this Quicks,

34
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,410
Let me check the spelling.

35
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,420
<v 1>Quicks,

36
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:55,820
How do I, It's like capital and X.

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,900
So I don't have, I don't think we have them quicks.

38
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,020
So let's add anyone, right?

39
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:08,940
And uh, comment is they are a diamond partner.

40
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,580
So this, uh, what kind of partner they are,

41
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,860
what kind of sponsorship package they have might be important because actually for data

42
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:21,540
natives, I know how much it costs them to,

43
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,660
to do this. So that helps.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,100
And then maybe what you can do now is,

45
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,020
uh,

46
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,210
this sap, I don't know what Persis,

47
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,530
SAP amplitude,

48
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,010
uh, native, what is it?

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,890
<v 1>Blockchain? No,

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,330
Native, Uh, what is that

51
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,770
<v 1>Also

52
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:50,980
Not interesting. And ibm.

53
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,300
So this two sap, uh,

54
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:57,100
amplitude, ibm. So Amplitude,

55
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,960
uh, maybe elements.

56
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:02,480
And this ones are like medium relevance.

57
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,240
This one, I don't know. What is that? Yeah,

58
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:09,040
I think I checked that. So you can add them.

59
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,760
And the way you do this is,

60
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:15,920
uh, because we already have this thing, right? So we can just duplicate records.

61
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,280
And then here, instead of Quicks,

62
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,920
you add, uh, I b M,

63
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,560
right? IBM again,

64
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:30,000
not here. And what kind of partner?

65
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,280
They're just partner.

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,430
<v 1>Partner,

67
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,550
Right? So then you will need to let me remove copy here.

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,790
So then you'll need to do this for SAP and

69
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:49,430
uploaded the rest.

70
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:54,150
I don't think they're super other one. Okay.

71
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,150
<v 1>Yeah.

72
00:03:57,151 --> 00:04:00,030
Let me just check what, what do we have here?

73
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,470
Yeah, I think that's all for this. So I will sometimes send you conferences

74
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,710
and we'll say, Okay, like, these companies seem relevant.

75
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,870
Please put them in the, in this thing,

76
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,280
in this table.
