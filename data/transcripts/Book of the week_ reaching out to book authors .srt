1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,970
I want to show you how heavy child to author.

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:05,670
So folks, um, so here at this,

3
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:09,060
uh, Dr. Moniker, I think he is a book author.

4
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:12,330
I'm not sure. So write about this in the introduction.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,490
Yeah. So let's say that I saw your somewhere.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
So I described where I see you. I saw him and then I say,

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:23,940
uh, the Tehran Datadog's cop community,

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,940
uh, what the community is about. And then I say that we have a

9
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,210
book of the week event. We invite book authors to ask questions about the

10
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:33,270
book. Then I sent the link that you probably saw.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,330
This is the link with more information about a book of the week.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,200
Um, yeah. So,

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,690
which is kind of basically, um,

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,460
what's happening there. And I asked if he will

15
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:51,060
be interested in taking part and,

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,690
uh, after that, uh, well, if he say yes,

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,010
then what I would next is I would go here.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,410
It's just not the right thing. Uh,

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,410
um, yeah. To this schedule yeah.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,020
To this thing. So would go here and then I would pick a no,

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,780
because lot here. And then I would ask him,

22
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:18,900
Hey, what do you think about this date? Does it work for you or

23
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:21,720
not? And if it works for him,

24
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:25,170
then we proceed with the rest of the browser.

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,420
So this is basically how, uh,

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,380
how it starts or the process of reaching out to authors,

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,830
um, start. Okay.

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,470
Um, that solo,

29
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,210
I wanted to show you in this video,
