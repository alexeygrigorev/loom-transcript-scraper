1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,170
Um, pillow. So regarding this document,

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,820
this is very tiny. So I really have to zoom in to see what's

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:13,440
happening. So please try to make it not so small.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,530
So one of the options could be you.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,100
So what I did here, oops, say just double click on this and then

6
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:22,860
you see, you can kind of zoom in.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,650
All right. And then, uh,

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,000
yeah, here, it's closer.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,750
So people like, if somebody will need to look at this,

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,210
they will see what's happening.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,610
And so,

12
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:42,180
and then next time you take a screenshot, try to make it more focused.

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,580
And if afterwards you did this,

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,140
so it's feasible, tried to Yeah.

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,570
To do it like that Now,

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,950
because otherwise it's just too little and it's not possible to see what's happening.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,180
I think the snow to should be here.

18
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,820
Um, yeah, because it's not really related to this one.

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,650
Um, I think,

20
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:19,570
<v 1>Yeah,

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,520
I should do it like that.

22
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:25,930
Oops.

23
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,090
Yeah. So please make sure that the screenshots are visible.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,010
So it's possible to see what's happening on these screenshots when you include them

25
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,580
in the doc.
