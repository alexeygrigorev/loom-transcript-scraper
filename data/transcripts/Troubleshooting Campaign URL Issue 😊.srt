1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,429
So I just noticed that this URL does not work and

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:09,216
the reason for that is that we forgot to put the right link.

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,372
Things happens, but Yeah, of course you need to be more you

4
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:20,200
need to pay more attention to detail. You know that So next time please

5
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:25,769
add this to one of the things to the this document where you

6
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:29,976
keep track of things to watch out for Anyways,

7
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:34,979
so this is actually fixable so I already sent this e-mail to the

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,628
in the e-mail to Elisabetta but actually it does

9
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:44,517
not work cause the real URL is this one we

10
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:49,645
forgot to update it and uhm

11
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:54,433
so the way I found out is I went to all campaigns in MailChimp

12
00:00:55,174 --> 00:01:00,532
so this is all campaigns then I go to uhh

13
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,065
it was in March, right?

14
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:09,918
so I find one in weird where

15
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:12,057
is the one in March?

16
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:18,996
should be somewhere here it's

17
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:19,477
weird

18
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:33,098
meh meh meh uh ah k

19
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:46,690
Yeah, so I think this is this one 4th of March Right,

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,413
so this is the campaign This is 4th of

21
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:54,598
March And this is the campaign.

22
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:58,005
So I go to details, and this is the link that we've updated.

23
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:03,067
It's actually still editable So we can write 103,

24
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:08,607
160, and now it works.

25
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:13,724
So if we forgot to update the URL and send the campaign anyways

26
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:18,793
it's still possible to update it. Now I also want you to go through

27
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:23,681
all the campaigns that we have here and check that

28
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:28,267
all the links are work. And if they do not,

29
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:32,436
update them using what I just showed. And of course we need to create

30
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:34,540
a process document just in case it happens again.
