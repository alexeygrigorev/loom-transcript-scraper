00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,010
So wanted to show you how to extract images from slug.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,030
So sometimes when I reach out to speakers,

3
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:11,490
I say, Hey, can I take a picture from slack?

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,870
So they already have a picture the way to extract a day.

5
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:20,460
Usually I go to click on a profile or

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,970
do search control key,

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,270
for example, name Janine. So then profile and

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,860
others. And this is,

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,590
uh, this is the image that we can use for creating a speaker profile.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,530
I think it's better to save it because I'm not sure how stable this

11
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:51,060
link is. Say, next time you

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,470
open, it will still work or not. Maybe it's better to just save it.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,130
And then you will upload this one created speaker profile.
