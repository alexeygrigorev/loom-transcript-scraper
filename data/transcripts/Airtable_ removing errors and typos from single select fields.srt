Hi. So I noticed that you accidentally put,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,040
uh, as relevance this as,

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,360
uh, H three C. So I wanted to show you how to,

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,760
uh, remove these things. So you go to this,

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:15,480
um, field, then you write customized field type,

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,160
and then you see old options. And then you,

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,040
we have this, um, so we should only have three.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,160
This three and this one are like typos,

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,800
so we can just remove them like that.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,740
Uh, now we'll say that, uh, yeah,

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:36,020
it'll lose some data. We just convert. And then you see now this one

12
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,490
is gone, so we can select medium here.
