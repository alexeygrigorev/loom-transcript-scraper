1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,520
Hi. So I created this table in air table.

2
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:06,400
So it's called Open Source Spotlight. If you go to Air table,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,120
you will find it here.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,080
This open source spotlight. Um,

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,560
yeah, so this is just, uh, you know, very similar to what we had

6
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:19,600
for the crm. Um,

7
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:24,280
what I really love about air cable is that you can add link links

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,480
between different, different,

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,280
uh, tables, different, uh, you know,

10
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:34,840
taps. So what I wanted to ask you is to move all the things

11
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:37,200
from here. Not all the things, only open source,

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,400
uh, spotlight stuff from here to,

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,600
um, it's not

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,460
okay. It's working. Um,

15
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:56,180
from here to, um,

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,820
this new table. And by the way, so here we just have one type

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,300
open source, but do we actually know which project is it?

18
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:07,260
So probably you'll need to find out, uh,

19
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,860
what is the project. Maybe the LinkedIn can tell what they're working

20
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:14,620
on. Hmm,

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,820
interesting. Yeah,

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,260
we will need to figure out, um, like ideally we should have kept the,

23
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,860
um, the url,

24
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:31,060
the GitHub url. Okay.

25
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:33,900
Like, we don't know it here.

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,180
We will need to find, but let me see.

27
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,100
Um, yeah, so this one,

28
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,100
it will be commonl, right? So this is the project

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,980
And we still have anyone present this project.

30
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,060
So it would be interesting to get somebody to present it.

31
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:54,140
And of course, I, I think this Joe Wolf,

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,620
we tried to contact this person in June.

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,300
They didn't answer, so we didn't fall up.

34
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,260
Um, okay, so I will take this thing and I will put it here.

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,460
So GitHub, then the project name would be,

36
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,340
I guess that's sort of be common. That's the project name,

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,140
right? Start. Uh, still <affirmative>,

38
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,620
I don't know. Let's, let's say new.

39
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,540
I will need to figure out. So these are the default statuses in air

40
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:37,580
Table. When you create a table, it just comes at book ups with the

41
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:41,700
status, new in progress. Done. Let's just start with new.

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,060
And then for people we add,

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,380
let's add Joe.

44
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,200
So do we know Joe's email?

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,920
You know, we don't have the, he's,

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,890
He's LinkedIn. We don't have email.

47
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,570
And the project is Rub, but now it's kind of

48
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,930
easy for us to uh,

49
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:16,170
understand like who, what are the people behind each project?

50
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,370
And then of course, like if Joe, we,

51
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,970
we should follow up with Joe of course. But if Joe is not answering,

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,650
then we can see, okay, this is still status new,

53
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,130
maybe status could be in you,

54
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:30,490
like you didn't do any research here,

55
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,050
so I just sent you a link. And then it's new.

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,810
Then in progress it means that,

57
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,650
uh, you started working on this, you found somebody,

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,650
but they haven't replied yet. We haven't scheduled a demo yet.

59
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:46,450
So then it's in progress. And then,

60
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,090
uh, done is, uh, we already recorded it.

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,850
Okay. Yeah, please, uh, document everything that I'm,

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,090
that I say here, like the status system, that could be important.

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,570
Okay, so we have the people,

64
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:07,090
the project. So what I would like to ask you to do is go

65
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:10,450
through all this, um, through all this,

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,690
uh, uh, document and for those projects,

67
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:18,570
for those open source projects that we haven't recorded yet,

68
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,290
or we, um, yeah,

69
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:25,930
we haven't recorded yet. Please move them to this

70
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,090
new table. And by moving,

71
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,410
I mean, uh, we,

72
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,530
<v 1>Uh,

73
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,210
We can just remove it from here. Uh,

74
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,810
and remove is like just, you know,

75
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,210
click on this and then,

76
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,010
um, this thing is not letting me. So

77
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:51,130
yeah, just delete and yeah.

78
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,330
Um, probably this date of last contact is also something important.

79
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,970
So maybe, uh, let's add it here.

80
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,090
<v 1>Lost

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,610
Contact date.

82
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,740
Okay, so that could be important. So yeah,

83
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:15,460
please fill it in. All the information from here.

84
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:18,340
And then for these people like Paul Ya,

85
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:21,220
who will need to figure out, uh, what is the project,

86
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,020
um, that they, uh,

87
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,260
that they're working on.

88
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,630
Yeah, I don't know if we'll need to have status for people too.

89
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,470
For, uh, people for projects,

90
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:39,030
Yes, for people we will see. And then there is a cool feature for

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,110
airflow. We can actually have CanBan view.

92
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,750
So you see that, uh, we have all these two,

93
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,110
uh, projects. So these are these two.

94
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,550
Let me just remove them.

95
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,830
So then we have, uh, this view.

96
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,080
And then let's say I just sent you,

97
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,320
um, a link. It's here in the new,

98
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,640
but then you can move it to progress and then you can move it

99
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,920
down. So it's very similar to Trla, right?

100
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,160
So there are different views. Um,

101
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,720
and then for people, let's see if we need to add status two to

102
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,000
have this view of what's happening there,

103
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,760
to see who we need to follow up with.

104
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,760
Yep. So please move all the information from here to there.

105
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,640
And, uh, we can start following up to some people because,

106
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,760
um, yeah, for example, these guys here,

107
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,280
uh, it's been a while, so let's try to follow up with them and

108
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,400
then see, um,

109
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,200
if they're interested, if they're not interested,

110
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,320
we can see what kind of projects they, uh,

111
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:52,640
worked on and we can try to conduct somewhere else from that project.

112
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,890
Okay, That's it.
