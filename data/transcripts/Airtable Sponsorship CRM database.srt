1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,470
Hi. So I wanted to talk to you about this sponsorship CRM table that

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:07,190
we have, an air table or database.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,720
So here, what we do, what I do is I keep track of all

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,080
the sponsored content I see online,

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,040
like in LinkedIn and Twitter, um,

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,320
everywhere. And, um,

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,800
like an example of this would be, so for example,

8
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:27,000
when I look, um, a world of Word demos,

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,400
you see this advertisement,

10
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:34,160
right? So potentially all these companies who run their

11
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:37,440
advertisement, they could be hm,

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,960
um, potential, um,

13
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:43,200
potential sponsors for the community, right?

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,560
Um, so what I do is,

15
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:51,690
um, I capture all these content,

16
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:54,370
sponsored content in this table.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,170
So it's called sponsored content. And then here we also have companies.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,850
So these are the companies who, um,

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,130
who produce this sponsored content, you know.

20
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:09,250
And then, um, so here we have links. So I know that,

21
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:11,490
uh, um, so Neptune,

22
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:14,090
for example, had this sponsored content,

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,770
right? So we can link this databases,

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,530
um, we can link this, uh, um,

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,330
tables in the database,

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,530
uh, with each other, right?

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,010
Maybe platform.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,280
Okay. So yeah,

29
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:39,120
it's, it's linkable. Did I save it or how do I save it?

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,760
<v 1>Okay.

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,820
Yeah, I think it was saved. Um,

32
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:48,860
and then also we here,

33
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:51,100
so we have a list of companies and, um,

34
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,460
each company has a status. So Prospect is a company which we have not

35
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:57,820
yet reached out. Um,

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,660
remember I was showing you how to reach out to companies.

37
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,220
Um, so this companies we haven't reached out yet to then

38
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:10,100
contacted is when we reached out, but we didn't get any response back.

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,980
And established contact is when they actually replied something back and we started talking.

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,060
And then client is when they actually decided to sponsor us to pay for

41
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,100
a newsletter or to run, um,

42
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,700
a workshop with us or sponsor the community.

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,660
So for example, scale, um, we run a campaign with them like a couple

44
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:33,420
of weeks ago, maybe you remember? And,

45
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,980
uh, then we also have past clients. So people who are,

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,020
who were our clients, but in the past.

47
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,060
So perhaps we need to reestablish contact with them.

48
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,690
And then we have last, uh, statuses loss declined is when,

49
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,450
uh, yeah, when we made a suggestion,

50
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:58,330
but they, uh, made it didn't answer anything or explicitly declined the,

51
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,920
um, sponsor in the community. Okay, So we have that,

52
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:04,040
the sponsored content I already showed you.

53
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,680
Then we have contacts. So this is the information about,

54
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,040
uh, um, about contacts,

55
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,240
about people who we talk to.

56
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,360
So like, I actually need to populate this more,

57
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,720
like, to add more data. I will probably ask,

58
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,400
uh, for your help with this.

59
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,640
Um, yeah. And then finally deals is,

60
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:30,360
uh, when we actually managed to somehow close,

61
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,640
like with, who was it? So here maybe I will add,

62
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,530
um, uh, mines to be workshop,

63
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,570
right? So the type would be workshop,

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,370
then company would be mines db and

65
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:54,630
contact would be Costa I an execution date.

66
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,470
Was it, um, last week?

67
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,720
Oops,

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,930
let me check. Yeah, it was six days ago.

69
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:09,610
What's the date? So September 21.

70
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,390
So would be September 21,

71
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,470
right? Um, yeah,

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,110
so this is called like CRM or client Relationship

73
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:27,470
Management. I think it stands for that.

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,990
Um, or customer relationship management. So here,

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,790
um, so I just want to keep track of,

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,990
um, everything we do for sponsorship.

77
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,910
And the way it starts is I find some sponsored content online,

78
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,750
and then I, um,

79
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,090
so this sponsored content belongs to some company.

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,250
Then we try to find somebody from this company to contact,

81
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,410
um, I already showed you how to do this, right?

82
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,930
And then, um, sometimes it goes well and we get a deal.

83
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,010
Sometimes they don't reply and then yeah,

84
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,290
well we, um,

85
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,890
no, well, sometimes they reply and decline too,

86
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,850
right? So it is just to keep track of all that.

87
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,250
And I wanted to show you how to add content here to sponsored content.

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,010
I actually wanted to show you,

89
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,490
So I recently saw, um,

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,170
some sponsored content from a newsletter.

91
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,220
So here I would probably just,

92
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,750
uh, forward you, mm,

93
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,350
now I need to find it. Uh, I would just probably forward you an

94
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:44,950
email or send you a link, and then you will fill it in and

95
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,110
uh, um, where it is,

96
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,070
um, sequence. So this

97
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:55,230
company that I'm looking for, they run,

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,770
um, a paid advertisement in a newsletter,

99
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,370
in some other newsletter, right? And, uh, because they did this in the other

100
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:07,970
newsletter, mm, I want to offer them to do it with us

101
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,290
too. So I will pause it for a sec.

102
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,330
Second, uh, I will find it and then I will continue.

103
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,400
Okay, I found this. So this is the guest post.

104
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,640
So this is, uh, is a sponsored post,

105
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:23,720
even though I don't think they explicitly say that this is sponsored,

106
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,110
but yeah, I think, um, yeah,

107
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,510
we thank a Leo for the support of the sequence.

108
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:34,590
So this was a sponsored post. So yeah,

109
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,030
I, um, I will not forward it right now to you because,

110
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,830
uh, well I will in the future, but,

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,750
so I will open it in the browser. So I will take this post

112
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,590
and I will go and open it in,

113
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,990
sponsor it content. So this would be the link,

114
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,630
actually, let me open it in this.

115
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,290
So then it's uh, let me just copy

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,360
for types of data errors. You can fix it now,

117
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,480
Content type is,

118
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,360
uh, hmm. Uh,

119
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,720
let me go with article. So it's guest post,

120
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:14,080
so kind of article. So then it's newsletter,

121
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,480
right? And then relevancy, let's say medium,

122
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,280
then company [Inaudible].

123
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,400
So we don't have this company, so we will add this.

124
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:30,190
So let me make sure I type it correctly.

125
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,430
So gle, so I just,

126
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:38,070
because, uh, there is no record in this company table with

127
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,190
Galeo. So I just created, and then content is,

128
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,950
um, let me just say guest post in the,

129
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,270
<v 1>Oops,

130
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,590
A guest post in the

131
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,110
<v 1>Sequence newsletter.

132
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,340
Okay? Yeah. So this is how we add content

133
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:08,520
to this table. And,

134
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,070
um, yeah,

135
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,470
perhaps I will also show you this one.

136
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,990
Mm, so how to do it with,

137
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,510
uh, um,

138
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:22,910
with Google search. So I will,

139
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:27,540
so this, so I will copy

140
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,500
this link and I will just,

141
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,260
um, put it here too. So probably

142
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:37,620
I will not send you this, uh,

143
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:43,060
Google search links. I will probably send you links from Twitter or LinkedIn.

144
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,020
Um, but uh,

145
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,740
for now, let me just, uh, also for completeness,

146
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,460
um, put this to, in,

147
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,830
in this spreadsheet. So I will,

148
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,990
so how do I do this for Google searches?

149
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,590
So I think here we have a source with Google search,

150
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,450
right? And then I usually write here in the comment what kind of word

151
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,450
search term was it? So then it is product

152
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,410
service here. This is not go away.

153
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,330
So this is not an ebook,

154
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,810
this is not an article. This is like a landing page for day product,

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,240
right? So then that's why the classification is product service.

156
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,760
Then source would be Google search.

157
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,080
Relevance is, um, well let's go with Medium.

158
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,080
And then company, Company is,

159
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,760
uh, let me close this one company.

160
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,510
Is Google Aios such

161
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:50,070
a long hero

162
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,980
And go com. Yeah,

163
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,700
I guess this is how you type it with,

164
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,880
I don't know if I have them. Did I type it correctly?

165
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,440
Yeah, so we create a new one because it doesn't exist.

166
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,360
And then the term ML ops search

167
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:21,560
journal. And then I will do the same for other things.

168
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,880
And then maybe at some point later,

169
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,520
I will show you how I do this for mm,

170
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,800
for LinkedIn, for Twitter, and also for YouTube.

171
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,760
So for YouTube, sometimes I get advertisement like,

172
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:37,640
do I have it now? No, but sometimes,

173
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,780
uh, like there are some I am watching for some videos,

174
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:46,060
and then there is an advertisement also for some relevant company,

175
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,420
right? And then the source would be YouTube in this case.

176
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,460
Mm. Okay. So yeah,

177
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,700
I think that's, um, that's what I wanted to show you.

178
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,780
So, okay, go away. So that's what I wanted to show you.

179
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,420
So this, uh, CRM table and that we have

180
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,540
four tabs, um, um,

181
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:11,140
here, four tables. And then maybe what you can do is you

182
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:15,740
can create an overview document of all these tabs and what they are needed

183
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:20,860
for. Um, and then also create process document

184
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,260
for, uh, adding stuff to this,

185
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,300
to sponsored content tap. And then for contacts and for deals,

186
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,620
we will talk about this later. I will also record,

187
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,780
record the video and,

188
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,220
uh, yeah, we will cover it there too.

189
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,140
So that's a.
