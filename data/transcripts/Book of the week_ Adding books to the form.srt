1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,480
Show you how to add books. So in the previous video,

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:06,450
I show you how to add authors or people in general.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,090
Now I want to show you how to add books.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,390
So, uh, there is another, uh,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,870
table here, another form. So this form is eight in the book.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,480
So let me copy this. I will also send it to you.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,190
And here we again, meet author CMIO.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,760
So this way I can match, uh, in this author with,

9
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:30,240
uh, the profile we just created so I can close it.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,000
So this is the same person we did last time.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,520
So email is here,

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,140
uh, and then since he's the only author we live with

13
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,380
empty, if he wasn't, then this is how we would add them.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,790
So now let's feel the rest of the things.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,920
Of course, you can just ask the author to,

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,580
um, to give you all this information,

17
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,170
like the title of the book description. Um,

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,720
but usually you don't need to do this because all the information is available

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,050
on the book page. So first of all,

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,340
the title, visual introduction to deep learning.

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,300
So this is the title then description.

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,100
Um, there's no worries here. Um,

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,130
Yeah, maybe this fine. So,

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,090
uh, this is not super concise. Uh,

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,480
I think it's fine. Let's give show then a book page.

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,610
I think this is the main book page. So these a book is self-published

27
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:42,180
so there is no, uh, publisher speech,

28
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,890
but, uh, yeah. Publisher is this mining or pact or a righty,

29
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,720
usually on their pages. So this would be a publisher's page

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,210
on mining. Um,

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,250
came about here. We did not feel it then books,

32
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,850
patron, Amazon, actually, I don't know if this book has a patron,

33
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:07,230
Amazon. Okay. We can check it on Google with usual introduction to deep learning.

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,470
Uh, no, I don't see it.

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,360
So, uh, and this in quotes to make sure that,

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,860
uh, we get it.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,770
No, they're just not on Amazon. So this is actually this book,

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,910
but this is not an Amazon. Okay.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,510
I think it means that this book doesn't have a patron,

40
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:36,090
Amazon, uh, books.

41
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,600
Good cop report. Yeah. We can also check that quickly.

42
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,850
Uh, let me get hot again.

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,950
There is no page on GitHub, but, uh,

44
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,900
yeah, if there was, maybe this book is because this is a self-published book,

45
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:54,150
this is not a good example, maybe for another book.

46
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,290
Um, I will show you how to find all the other fields.

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,080
Um, but yeah, so this is how you add this.

48
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,610
You click submit and then now I should see it

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,190
here. Yeah, no, I have it here.

50
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,060
So this is called you submit a book. Um,

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,820
actually this is weird.

52
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,430
Um, the date is invade is missing.

53
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,790
I don't know where it, uh, what

54
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,000
happened, but let me quickly add, uh, so here,

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,870
um, you ignored this part, so this is not something you need to document

56
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,420
you just fast forward this,

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,550
uh, uh, yeah,

58
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,580
so I want to edit date here field.

59
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,850
So don't pay attention to this.

60
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,870
So this will be the start date.

61
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,180
And, um, we need to end this,

62
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,220
let's see here, book breach.

63
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,090
Yeah. That description, um,

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,190
their week, then one day a week

65
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,090
when the, uh, around how class.

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,690
So yeah, so this is pretty important.

67
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,770
Um, so let me open this form again,

68
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,390
and that will show you how to heal in this particular field.

69
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,890
So you just click on this field and then we have the schedule two

70
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,630
and schedule, we have this mentor who is on 14th of February.

71
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,160
So yeah.

72
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,270
So then here you select 14th of February.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,050
So this will be there Monday of the week where it starts.

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,390
So here in, uh,

75
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,530
this schedule, we'll have it here,

76
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,190
send these is when it starts. So you just need to put it there

77
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,440
and yeah, no, you click submit and yeah.

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,670
And I will just manually add this and you can pretend that they added

79
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:08,800
this through, uh,

80
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,760
through the form. Okay. So now I have this and database,

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,900
so it's actually through the form. And then the next thing you need to

82
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,990
do is you need to tell me, forum is there for ready,

83
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,800
and then I will execute the script. And then after it script is executed,

84
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,050
we have, sorry, we can mark

85
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:34,210
this as announced. So now maybe the status could be a forum

86
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,800
or something like this. So now I know that forms fields.

87
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,590
I need to execute this my best after you do this,

88
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:46,210

and then I will pick you again. Um,

91
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,190
you can just change it to announced after I do this.

92
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,270
Okay. That's all I wanted to show you. No,
