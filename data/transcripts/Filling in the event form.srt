1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,160
Um, I wonder the show you call this speaker pro speaker,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,310
not speaker the event form.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,620
So, um, this, this, I just sent you the link.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,350
So I want now to add to the form,

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,910
uh, the first field is speaker email,

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,630
email email here,

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,280
then tight

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,000
and bright. Eileen is this thing here in

9
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,060
the Euro. Um,

10
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,510
you can also get it if you vote, you haven't bright slash my events.

11
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,350
So it has the list of all the events.

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,030
And let me say this, the amount here,

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,120
corporate know, uh,

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,430
it cost to your, um,

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,570
well, well you can paste it now.

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,170
And then it quite basic to my,

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,210
uh, others Euro bar. I get this and I'm interested in this number,

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,980
this number, and this number is the same

19
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:28,370
number.

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,020
Uh, I just need to paste it here. So this event is a podcast

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,720
and date is a 3rd of March,

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,420
right? And so

23
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,810
let's call you submit events. And then using this information,

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,690
I will be able to publish events on the website.

25
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,110
And of course, this is important that for this form,

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,980
um, the speaker is already there.

27
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:06,840
So you're already thinking you already created the profile for the speaker,

28
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,380
because if you don't do this, then I will not be able to find

29
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,870
the speaker, uh, in,

30
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,820
uh, in the database. And then I will not be able to create another.

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,200
So first you fill in the speaker form,

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,560
and then if you, in the event for.
