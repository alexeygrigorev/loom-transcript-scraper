1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,810
Okay. So I found a good YouTube video and they want to reach

2
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:11,250
out to this speaker and right here to our,

3
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,780
um, to our events as well. So what I do is

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,700
hear your name right by copying

5
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:25,950
his name. Then I go to LinkedIn,

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,920
I search. And then, you know,

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,340
this is here. Now you see pictures.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,190
Well, I guess here kind of hard to see,

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,900
but this is Kara. And now I want to reach out

10
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:42,390
to your saying, Hey,

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,300
I saw your talk. Do you want to run this community?

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,740
Do you want to also give a talk?

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,500
So for that and to connect and

14
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,440
then hi, Meryl. Um,

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,220
see I run a co-op community.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,120
And for you, you can say I'm a community manager at data talks club,

17
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,790
community, or at Databox club,

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,070
um, around Datadog's community. I saw your talk about,

19
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,180
um, or here

20
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,990
could be, I saw your talk with tech,

21
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,140
for example, or we can work on that template.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,230
That's what you're talking about. I was wondering if you'd

23
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:45,690
be interested in doing a work about

24
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,530
us and the workshop.

25
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,770
So here, I want to invite your not to do the same talk.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,320
Sometimes most of the times probably I would actually invite for that,

27
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,250
but here I want to, uh, to invite here,

28
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:10,080
to do a workshop about Kettering, the workshop is like a hands-on thing.

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,300
Um, but anyways, yeah, that's all actually,

30
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:19,980
I want to write with,

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,520
uh, techno for example,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,340
or, yeah, it doesn't matter. I saw your talk about Kara.

33
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,150
That was wondering if you'd be interested in doing a workshop with us.

34
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,710
I think that's, that's a patient.
