1
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:05,317
So, I wanted to show you how to check historical rates,

2
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:09,504
so let's create a process document for that.

3
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:12,550
And, uh, we have this book.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,458
Why did I don't tell it?

5
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:34,707
Okay, yeah, so what the? Okay,

6
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:37,888
so we have the uh the kick-end document.

7
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:42,495
Yeah, I guess it's been a while since I opened it last time and

8
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:49,125
umm so you need to check the price umm

9
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:53,670
like the actual amount they paid and then, and let's say it's not 15

10
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:58,150
but I don't don't remember how much was it? I would say 17 whatever

11
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:03,630
and this is how much it was on,

12
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:08,343
this one is big and deep big was

13
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:11,703
it but uh 12?

14
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,723
right so then um. Good one, good one,

15
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:16,764
good one, good good one.

16
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:21,391
we know how much was it right so it wasn't uh it wasn't

17
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:25,938
the exact amount and then when you write to our accountants

18
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,481
you can say that yeah you pay it in uh use.

19
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:34,142
Z but yeah the cost of like exchange rates whatever this

20
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:36,629
is how much we received so it's different from the English okay.

21
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,311
All right.
