00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,110
Hi, uh, sometimes we help other communities,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,080
uh, to promote their events. So for example, here,

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,110
this is our meetup. And then this on this meetup,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,410
we cross post to, we create another event,

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,780
um, from envelopes community, they have an event and we also create the same

6
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:21,270
kind of event. So this is actually an in-person event,

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,410
uh, where it is, uh, there is this others,

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,380
right? So this is, uh,

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,990
this is already created. This has already our group,

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,110
right? So I want to show you how to do this.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,670
So there is a, uh, also an event and they asked us to cross

12
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,850
promote their event. So this is what I want to do now.

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,850
So I will start with copying the details so

14
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,360
I can get the details and copy them here.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,080
Now pay attention to the line rate breaks here.

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,430
So like these say yes.

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,110
Um, um,

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,700
no, no, this should be fine.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,410
Then I already, I already saved the image,

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,150
so I just want to evolve this. So it is the image that I

21
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:23,740
saved. I, now

22
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:27,760
we need to copy the data. So the data is July five.

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,550
Oops. Um,

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:43,060
6 30, 6 32.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,230
Oops, let me just close this deal.

26
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,870
It's for three hours. So,

27
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,740
Um, yeah, I think here,

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,410
um,  so then again,

29
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,380
you would be this planet labs,

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,140
Germany. Let me check if it actually,

31
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,050
it actually can find it. Yeah.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,930
And this one we of course need to make sure that the address is

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,150
the same one. Yes.

34
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,440
The address is the same one. So this is not an online event.

35
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,990
And then yeah, we need to also check this COVID safety measures.

36
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,010
So the event will be indoors.

37
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,230
So indoor. Oops.

38
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,290
Um, it doesn't seem like mosques are required or COVID workstations are required.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,780
Otherwise I think that it will be same.

40
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,440
Um, yeah. Now we need to,

41
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,910
to do the title.

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,510
So the title is, um,

43
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,860
I think it's a speaker 9 billion women in data,

44
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,580
and then we need to, uh, on this. So we need to follow the

45
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:59,320
same pattern here. So you see like first it's the name and

46
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:02,140
then in parenthesis, this one.

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,200
So I want to do something like basic, um,

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,640
meal,

49
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,140
right? I think this is the name of the community,

50
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,020
female tech leaders. Yeah.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,240
So I think that's all.

52
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,620
Yeah, no, I'm going to just,

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,010
um, I think I need to add the cost.

54
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:36,550
So the cost is this one.

55
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,970
I don't know if he's in the group,

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,400
she's probably not see.

57
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,730
Yeah. I wanted to add here as she's not in the group.

58
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,340
So I cannot add her as a host.

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,540
Yeah, I think I

60
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,950
just hit publish.

61
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,850
Okay. Let's call you cross post events from other communities.
