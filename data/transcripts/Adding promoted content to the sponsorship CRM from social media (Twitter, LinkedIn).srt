1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,720
And here we have an example of a paid promotion on LinkedIn.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,960
So you see this is a company data stacks,

3
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:11,580
and you see that this content is promoted and it appears in

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,380
my feed. And so they are advertising the book,

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,540
Cassandra, the Definit, the definitive guide.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,700
So I would typically copy link to this post and send it to you.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,060
So for you, when I share this link,

8
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:27,500
you will not see it as promoted, right?

9
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:30,340
Because it was promoted in my feed. Um,

10
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:32,420
but yeah, this is, uh, promoted stuff,

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,140
right? So here, if we fill this in,

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,100
um, this, uh, crm,

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,420
so I think I already have them. Let me quickly check,

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,620
uh, cause um, there are, yeah,

15
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:49,140
so we already have them. So let me just show you how I did

16
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:52,020
this. So I, this is the title of the book,

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,820
then the link. I think this is the same content.

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,540
Yeah, I think it's, it's actually the same link that I,

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,420
uh, put before. So content type is ebook,

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,700
because this is an ebook, right?

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,180
And then source LinkedIn. This is LinkedIn,

22
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:12,580
right? The source is LinkedIn. And if it was a paid promotion on Twitter,

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,860
then the source would be Twitter, right?

24
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,820
Then uh, the company and then comment.

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,860
So we already have data stacks and here I think that's

26
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:25,060
the only content.

27
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,340
Uh, we have this Cassandra,

28
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:32,060
definite definitive guide. Okay.

29
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:35,020
Yeah. So this is how you add sponsored content,

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,060
uh, promoted content from social media like Twitter and LinkedIn.
