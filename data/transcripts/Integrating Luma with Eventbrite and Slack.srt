Hi, so I started looking into integrating like

2
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:07,940
doing this sort of integration we have, we had with Eventbrite,

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,550
where when we create an Eventbrite event,

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,490
it would automatically publish a message in Slack.

5
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:19,353
And, what else?

6
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,173
And create an entry in a Google Calendar. Alright.

7
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:25,733
So we wanted to do something similar for Luma,

8
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:30,573
and it seems like in Luma it works through calendars.

9
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:36,788
So I created a calendar. This data talks club events.

10
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:40,888
And you are an admin.

11
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:44,698
I sent you an invite. And here,

12
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,038
every time you create an event in Luma, you can edit.

13
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:51,103
Here. So this is how you add an existing one.

14
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,583
So add existing Luma events and then you just,

15
00:00:57,303 --> 00:01:02,523
well, submit them, right? So this is how you create a

16
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:08,945
existing events, which we already have,

17
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,485
right? And then you can also create a new one.

18
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,265
So here when you click on element, yeah,

19
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:19,025
create a new event and then you can just do it

20
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:21,749
from here. It's like you can select it,

21
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:26,589
you know, whether you create it like from personal calendar or date of events,

22
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,989
right? So then you create it from here.

23
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,569
I don't know if what you see when

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,991
you create like other events. Same or not.

25
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,431
If it's different and you prefer the other way of creating,

26
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:46,151
then instead of just creating it like now,

27
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:51,711
yeah, we can just add first create an event in Luma and then

28
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:56,645
add it. But it's important that we add it because this way now

29
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:59,005
I can use, ah,

30
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:05,075
the integration from here to Zapier and from Zapier to

31
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:08,125
other platforms. Okay.

32
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:10,746
So, please document it.
