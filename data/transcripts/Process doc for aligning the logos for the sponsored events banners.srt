1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,120
Just going to come get, so see that it is a land,

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,200
so it's centered, so they are centered focus.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,110
Then I grew up to consider it and just the logos and

4
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:20,790
then put down in the center

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,550
then.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,420
Yeah. Something like this. So what I don't like to hear this logo is

7
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:41,010
a bit larger, so maybe we can just add a little bit more

8
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,860
to the side. So it feels like a good logo,

9
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:50,000
sir. Maybe more centered, just a little bit like

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,740
that. So if they were of the same size,

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,920
then they would be like super center,

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,950
according to pigments deadlines per center.

13
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:02,760
But since this one is a bit larger and just move to the legal

14
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,690
bit, so it feels

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,390
okay. Yeah. So that's, let's call it.
