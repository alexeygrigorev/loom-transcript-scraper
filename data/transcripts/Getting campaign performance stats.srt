00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,840
Hi, I'm just wanted to show you how to answer emails like that.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,240
So we'll need your help, but with the,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,060
with the answer, um,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,330
so the male asks about information,

5
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:14,910
about performance of the complaint they run with us.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,510
So basically this promoted, um,

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,240
this promoted, uh, uh,

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,410
ads, uh, this promoted section in the email.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,180
Um, so they ask about 90 ML and that was,

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,940
um, let me find it,

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,700
I think it was

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,080
this one, perhaps

13
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:55,390
<v 1>74, 4 73.

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,750
Yeah. So you see this nanny MLS here,

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,050
so they are interested in a number of clicks,

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,850
um, from the campaign still we can,

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,660
uh, tell us your 187

18
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:23,550
people clicked on the article and then 125

19
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,340
people clicked on, um,

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,110
on their link to their website. Then we also,

21
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:34,590
I think we had to,

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,020
we posted it on social media,

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,440
so we should go to Twitter

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,460
and then in data docs, club profile.

25
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,650
And, um, now I'll try to find it.

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,130
I think this is the one, right.

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,480
Um, Lytics.

28
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,900
So yeah, you can tell her that I'm like,

29
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,000
okay, let me find you how to properly find it.

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,310
Uh, yeah, let me just that one. So

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,150
analytics number of impressions and clicks.

32
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,100
So you can tell  on social media

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,020
and then on LinkedIn, I think we also have this on LinkedIn,

34
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,810
so 10 then go to the company,

35
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,550
then find it.

36
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,160
Okay. It wasn't well, okay, here it is. And then you click controls

37
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:02,650
that and then will tell her that it had this many impressions

38
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:07,210
and that many clicks, and then we can just send all this information to

39
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,750
care. Um, I think she's also asking,

40
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:14,710
uh, about, uh, YouTube videos,

41
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,910
600 views, but I don't know what kind of information she needs there.

42
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,780
So maybe you can just ask her okay.

43
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,240
That's all. And, uh, yeah, in the future,

44
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,910
there will be similar requests from others.

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,730
Um, I will ask you to help me answer them.
