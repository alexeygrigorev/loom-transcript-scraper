1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,247
So I want to show you how to actually deal with issues like that

2
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:08,690
So when we see that something failed,

3
00:00:08,691 --> 00:00:13,206
let me start from the beginning So it fails right and then we

4
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:17,499
click on this thing and we see where it failed on this tab,

5
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:21,159
right? And we see that it processed 0 people So ok,

6
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:26,099
there are So these logs indicate where exactly the problem

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,139
is It usually helps us So,

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,559
let's see So, processed 0 people,

9
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:36,408
so there were no problems problems with people And people come from this

10
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:42,015
tab And here we have this

11
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:45,268
to add, right? So this is the part that it goes,

12
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:50,278
it fetches So it fetches all the people People from that you add

13
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:53,221
And there are zero people So yeah,

14
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:57,728
it didn't process anything Now it processes books

15
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:02,634
Then we see that this is the book it tries to process And

16
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:07,459
it's It's successful But

17
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,284
because it Failed later.

18
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:15,609
We will need to re-add this book. I'll show you how Okay, but then

19
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,652
we have a process podcast.

20
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:21,396
So it processes processed zero podcast events.

21
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:26,473
Again, uhm it comes from podcast here.

22
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:28,555
There was nothing to process.

23
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,830
If we were to do it, there was nothing to process.

24
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,734
That's why it was zero. And then it tries to process events.

25
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:38,882
And this is where the error happens,

26
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:43,147
right? Um, so it says key error email,

27
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:45,420
whatever, right? So for you,

28
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,883
it's not important which error is,

29
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:50,407
but that the error is with events.

30
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:52,804
We see that here.

31
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:55,318
The last thing, events. So we can go to events,

32
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,214
we can go to to add, and we see that this last thing

33
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:03,388
is weird, right? So what we're going to do is we can just delete

34
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:08,533
it, or let's say here the error is that this field

35
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:11,587
email is empty, right?

36
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:13,849
And yeah, it's empty because there's nothing.

37
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,393
So if there was an error,

38
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:19,187
a record with an empty email,

39
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:22,100
this is what we would see.

40
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,949
But now I will just delete it.

41
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,041
It should solve the problem, though.

42
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:31,385
It should solve the problem, although there is still one issue,

43
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:33,758
right? So if we go to to add,

44
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,991
there is nothing. There is empty, right?

45
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:41,003
Because this thing processed, but because it failed at a later step,

46
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:45,268
it will not be added. So what we need to do is we need

47
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,944
to go to book of the week and we know from the logs which

48
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:54,520
book we need to change. So this is

49
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:58,093
the book from Andy. So we just go to go and change from done

50
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,830
to to do. And now we should be able to

51
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:07,726
re-execute it. Rename it all,

52
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:10,766
run workflow, let's see,

53
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:14,967
I think it's running.

54
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:24,050
Yeah, so I'll put a pause now and when it finishes I'll

55
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:28,085
show the results. Okay, it's successful.

56
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:31,119
Let's take a look at the logs.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,772
So you will see how good logs look like.

58
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,526
So it processed zero people like last time.

59
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:40,120
Then, okay, now it's running the book.

60
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,483
So this is the description of the book.

61
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:44,681
So it's processed one book.

62
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,255
Processed zero podcasts, processed zero events.

63
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:52,722
So, um, I think what we can do is we should create a document

64
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:57,659
how to debug, um,

65
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,041
this adding, um, content to the website.

66
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,464
Events, podcasts, um,

67
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:07,180
books, and so on. Uh, and mentioned there

68
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:11,846
the previous loom that the information from the previous loom that I

69
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:14,900
added, um,

70
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:17,647
like we can perhaps. make a link to,

71
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:21,352
um,

72
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:24,856
to this loom where I show how to add people like Andy,

73
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:29,172
right? And yeah, this one. And we will,

74
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:32,459
like, if more error appears,

75
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,015
we, I, I will take a look and then we can

76
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:39,379
populate this document. But for now,

77
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,772
at least if there is an error like that,

78
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:44,065
you should be able to figure it out yourself,

79
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:46,359
hopefully. Okay,

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,670
thank you.
