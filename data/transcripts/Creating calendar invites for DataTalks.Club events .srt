1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,920
I just wanted to show you how we can simplify this process.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,780
Um, so I'm talking about this creating calendar invites.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,690
So, um, national bar stays

4
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:19,980
like that. The second stage step stays like that Then.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,070
Okay. Let me just read this hour.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,570
Um, and then you add guests like guests,

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,720
it's Just an example.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,240
And then you click on more options and then you end up immediately

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,590
in the,

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,530
And sit in more options. You add time.

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:55,150
So it should start usually by This

12
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:58,090
time. Well, if I click here,

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,420
Yeah, I think, Um,

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,170
I don't know if you can, I think you can sell it.

15
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:12,560
So please also do that central European time.

16
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:18,410
Berlin, if you can do this, it will help with Daylight

17
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,700
saving and things like this.

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,560
<v 1>Okay.

19
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,630
So yeah, click here. So of course, to not say click on this thing,

20
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,640
just implant, Um,

21
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,920
and then for location,

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,280
like we hear this And

23
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:45,290
then here, Um,

24
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,420
and then get permission. Shouldn't be made if I have other secrets,

25
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,790
this is important.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,060
Um, and yeah, this is why we do this. And then after that,

27
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:02,120
you click say, I will not do this because the spoken that does not

28
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,450
exist

29
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,170
if you do screenshots would be correct name.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,910
Yeah. You click on this, but, uh, yeah,

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,870
two will not work because this guest does not exist, but hopefully it will

32
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,150
give you an idea how to do it without, uh,

33
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,510
you know, saving and then editing men do all this kind of stuff.
