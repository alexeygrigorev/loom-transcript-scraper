Hi, I wanted to show you one thing.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,320
So now in Luma there is this thing which means that,

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,320
uh, we are getting these emails every time somebody signs up.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,440
And um, yeah, it's just noisy. So what we can do is just,

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,520
and tick this so we don't have this anymore,

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,040
and then we will not receive it, um,

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,800
receive these things. So please make it a part of the process doc for

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,320
creating events. So then, yeah,

9
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,480
we don't get a lot of, uh, a lot of noise.
