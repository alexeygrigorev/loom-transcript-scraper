1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
That's that we use for our events.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,190
So now I want to show you how, instead of, so previously we were

3
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,890
using for doing this.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,310
So maybe you remember, I showed it in one of the previous videos plots.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,070
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,890
Yeah. So this firm, this is what we used to previously.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,100
Now we'll have, um,

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,840
templates. So now I want to show you how to actually do this in

9
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:35,970
a new template. So we use Figma for that.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,540
Now we have this event banner thing,

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,430
which we need to change. And so they

12
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,400
went with is a lot testing microservices.

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,190
, let's change this. Um,

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,500
this is quite large title.

15
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:03,090
So let me and do something

16
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:07,580
like this. And then we say,

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,860
why is it? Oops,

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,870
microservices or robustness,

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,820
scalability. And we

20
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:26,450
can just be Kenny part of the title.

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,580
Then we pick this one and microservices and

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,940
change the form to this blue one.

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,330
So it looks a bit nicer than the name of the speaker.

24
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,840
We need to also change. So previously we didn't have the name of a

25
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,940
speaker on the banner.

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,670
Now we need to change that. So the name is,

27
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,250
and my nail and

28
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,900
update is here, and then we need to change that.

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,080
U-turn. So to change the picture,

30
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,410
just go to speaker,

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,060
um,

32
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,020
yeah, it's a big kind of person photo and yeah,

33
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,980
yeah, yeah. It's a two,

34
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,620
this photo control these year.

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,630
So we go here and then there's this few image and click on this

36
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,820
and they choose a different image. And then we have all the images in

37
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:43,080
our GitHub. Repo could be other place right now,

38
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,840
all the images. They have, all the images there,

39
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,060
certainly the sort of data docs club, GitHub, IO.

40
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,620
Then we have even just folder then.

41
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,090
Um, and then here I type in,

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,930
uh, and then it can cope and

43
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:06,270
then we'll have a picture here,

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,370
close it. And this is the amount of,

45
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:15,120
of her. Um, and now I just

46
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:19,820
click here and

47
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,900
then at the bottom here,

48
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:28,230
I click expert, but mother saved

49
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,990
and see here.

50
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,200
Um, I think I want to change it slightly.

51
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,730
You will probably not need to do this.

52
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,100
I will do it now. And then,

53
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,850
uh, you will eat, will be adjusted.

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,180
So you want to move it a bit,

55
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,040
so it's like  yeah.

56
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,090
Yeah. So properly centered.

57
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,780
I think we sort of

58
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,990
sought proper decent there. Okay.

59
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,570
No,

60
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,360
no. Okay. So you will want me to do this.

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,670
You will just need to change the title to picture and right.

62
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,470
And different in the future. I want to write a script that will generate

63
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:37,950
this. So you will not need to worry about that. This is what we

64
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:42,120
have. So now that likes sports

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,620
and now I use this for creating an event.

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,990
So this flow you already saw,

67
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,610
let me just quickly not go into details,

68
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:59,700
but just want to remind your car exactly.

69
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:05,160
To, uh, uh, chop this.

70
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,790
Okay. So we already have spoken the relationship something.

71
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,380
So now I click copy.

72
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,430
And then now that the title there,

73
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:33,540
I'll just copy it across. Yeah. And

74
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,230
yes.

75
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,570
And somebody, sometimes I need to think,

76
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,870
because I didn't prepare this lesbian.

77
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:51,090
Look at the outline. E

78
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:51,480
S

79
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,570
<v 1>I think something like

80
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,020
a lot,

81
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,320
something like this, I don't know. I just came up with this.

82
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,950
You will not need to do this. You will probably have a subtitle or

83
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,990
ready. This is something I should have asked this speaker and the guest.

84
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,110
Now the date is actually

85
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:57,080
next week is the date

86
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,510
is also Tuesday. So start.

87
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:03,560
And then the staff time on time is not changed.

88
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,220
Could prevent

89
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,780
no it's created, they call to details.

90
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,290
And I LD that image.

91
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,000
Look at this new banner and here it,

92
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,230
this is how we'll do this at your order. So the rest of the

93
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:35,020
form, um, one thing though,

94
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,320
that was different,

95
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,850
um, boundless. So for events.

96
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:50,080
So this is for events and like,

97
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:56,860
this is for webinars and this farm for different.

98
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,150
Okay, nevermind. We can just use this for everything.

99
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,550
And then maybe that will update this instruction,

100
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,320
uh, to tell you what executives do. But for now,

101
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,680
this is how you use Figma to create even.
