1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,240
To show you how I create events,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,370
how I can make announcement for the events,

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,740
but the events. So, first of all,

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,260
we have two types of events. Well, actually there are more,

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,110
but two main ones are webinars and live podcasts.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,200
So right now I want to create a lifeboat customer.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,040
Um, there are no, there are not so many.

8
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,820
They are not so many different when it comes to creating announcements.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,180
Um, but for podcasts, we have documents like that,

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,310
that, uh, roughly outline, uh,

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,800
what podcast will be about in here.

12
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:35,610
We have title and subtitle. So,

13
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:38,040
uh, for the title, this is the title of payment.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,180
Um, sorry. I needed to answer to make it,

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,040
uh, anyways, so this is the event that we need to create right now.

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,260
So for that, I'll go to Canva. So

17
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,380
first we need to create a visual for the event for that we use

18
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:02,980
Commonwealth and the

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,550
title is quite short. That's why,

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,050
so there are two options, two line title and one line title.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,020
So we need to, this is a short title,

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,860
so we need one line. So it goes here and paste it.

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,100
I already created it. Um, but yeah,

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,550
there was something different. It just double click on this.

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,100
And then based on the title,

26
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,800
then download selected backpack clicked on lot.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,190
So this is how you create a visual for the events. This process is

28
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:37,930
the same for both webinars and interviews with

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,790
costs. And now next we need to go to Eventbrite

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,310
seven, right? Is the platform we use for creating events.

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,810
Um, so I'm on the ride.com/my events.

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,090
Then it rejects to this organization events.

33
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,040
And yeah, so these are the events that we have E upcoming events.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,530
So this, uh, uh, this game that we have here and

35
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,870
yeah, none of these events you see,

36
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,800
so one of them is a webinars. It has this TV thing here,

37
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,120
and the other one is a workshop. What we need to get an event

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,740
that is what customer, but that we go to past events.

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,100
And so this product management essential is for data professionals.

40
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,590
This was at podcast,

41
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,390
we'll have microphones here. So I click on this product management

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,470
essentials. Oops, I don't need to click on this.

43
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,060
So you move it, I think. Or so what I wanted to

44
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,030
do is past,

45
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,930
again, what I want to do click is here,

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,710
these dots, and then I want to click copy.

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,830
So no, they went is copied. So now go back to this document and

48
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:05,270
then I quickly the title. And then I copy the

49
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,230
subtitle as well. The subtitle subtitle also

50
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,350
contains the name of the person,

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,340
and then we need to select the date. So the date for this event

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,450
is here in the title 28,

53
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,410
this Friday, start on.

54
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:30,560
That should be the same. Usually we have events at 5:00 PM,

55
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,010
but this one is a little bit different.

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,620
So we agreed to have this at 1:00 PM.

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,190
And then in time is usually the events take one hour.

58
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,830
So that's why it's one hour.

59
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,260
And then I click here, copy them line event page.

60
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,040
So it will copy everything from there, from that previous event.

61
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,210
Okay. Copy event.

62
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,040
Okay. Now I caught two details

63
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,400
in details. I need to, first of all,

64
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,820
change the image to click delete,

65
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,870
then click on this thing and go to download and then select this one

66
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,330
could hear coaching. And then now

67
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:26,930
I need to change the outline. So mine is here

68
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,750
and then information about the guests. Uh,

69
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,870
yeah, I don't think I, Hmm.

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,590
Okay. I don't feel like a, typically I would have a larger biography here.

71
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,320
I don't think I got this from Lynsay.

72
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,610
So let me just copy that.

73
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,770
That works. Then we can later updated

74
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,080
then. Yeah. Let's not make the gap too large.

75
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:11,670
And then I click save. So that sometimes happens

76
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,770
that, you know, it looks a bit ugly.

77
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,540
I need to clean it a little bit.

78
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,030
So that's more Alliance for whatever reasons I don't know.

79
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:25,330
Right. And I click safe again.

80
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,450
This time it should be a pain. Then

81
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,670
I go to online event page.

82
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,820
So first of all, let me check that everything's updated.

83
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,760
So main event images, updated description,

84
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,900
some of these updated descriptions of data next take or two line on page.

85
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,050
And here, this is a link to our previous,

86
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,920
to our previous event. So we need to update this one.

87
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,760
Uh, so for that correct link should be YouTube dot slash C slash Datadog's

88
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:02,000
club. This is the URL for our YouTube channel.

89
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,500
And I just paste it here, PS,

90
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,180
then this one, probably with the www.

91
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,820
It works. Yeah.

92
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,430
So then I click save and then

93
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,680
she gets a one thing we need to check in tickets

94
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,750
to make sure that yeah,

95
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,250
so it depends on, uh, January at 2:00 PM.

96
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,920
So it should end after the event and score later,

97
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,390
but not before, because sometimes there is an error and for whatever reason,

98
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,470
um, ticket sale finishes before the event starts.

99
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,170
So I always double check that it's not the case here.

100
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,300
So here it's not the case. It,

101
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,460
the sale ends after the payment ends,

102
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,090
which is, uh, the correct behavior they expect to be here.

103
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,540
Now I click on publish and here I see it's,

104
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,090
uh, three public published now.

105
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,090
So yeah, here and I think for change, I just click,

106
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:07,540
publish.

107
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,560
Okay, cool. Now, uh,

108
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:22,430
we use, uh, was that there for integration?

109
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:25,520
So what happens is now in slack,

110
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,470
we should have this announcement channel and to see that even bright

111
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,310
creates this announcement saying that we've just created a new event,

112
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,110
career coaching, and it describes everything by WhatsApp.

113
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,750
It also does is if go to eat up.

114
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,560
If I go to meet up, then I go to the group,

115
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,000
I organize and then go click,

116
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,880
click, click treatment. And

117
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:03,590
they did a saved draft, actually had recently received

118
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,500
an email from meetup saying that from Zapier,

119
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,540
saying that they are going to stop supporting integration with meetup sometime

120
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:17,480
in the future. So probably after sometime this video will not be actual.

121
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,460
It will need updating, but it at least to give you an idea of

122
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,570
what exactly now, how exactly you can create an event in meetup.

123
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,880
So right now we have a draft here. Now I click edit and

124
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,340
here is here. It already has a title. It has a date.

125
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,950
It has a time duration,

126
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,140
one hour, it doesn't have a picture.

127
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,060
So I need to upload a picture. So there's the same picture

128
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,210
we used. So it needs a bit of cropping.

129
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,050
And then the text here is not formatted.

130
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,830
I need to format it. So responsibilities

131
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,270
<v 1>To go, coach what's called problems.

132
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,610
It's not then about the guests.

133
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,860
And then I usually remove this thing.

134
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:09,780
Can just leave this joint. And yeah,

135
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,530
yeah, this is pretty arbitrary, but a leave it like that,

136
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,090
then make this event online. And then I select our YouTube channel,

137
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,170
the sending cause we used in right then here,

138
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,570
I don't know to all guests. I don't know why is up here,

139
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,380
keeps creating it like that. And then yeah,

140
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,960
click publish. So that period here,

141
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,860
just copy some information. So then I need to edit it a little bit,

142
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,540
but not more than that. And when this integration with Zapier stops working,

143
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,140
I'll probably need to put this main area,

144
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,610
which probably will be quite annoying. But yeah,

145
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,200
I think I just noticed, I just clicked also on an osteo

146
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:56,070
lens. So this is also an important step because now everyone who is in

147
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:59,730
our meetup group will get an education that are one is created.

148
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,950
Okay. I think that's all. So this is how we create events in Eventbrite

149
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,280
and meetup. And yeah.

150
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,580
So now we have this event here, um,

151
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,590
and that's, that's all.
