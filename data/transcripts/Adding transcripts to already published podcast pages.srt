1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,080
Hi, I wanted to show you two transcripts,

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:06,540
two pages that are already created.

3
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,640
So for example, for this, for data science,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,960
from the science and data engineering, public was a bit late because he was

5
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:16,470
moving countries. So he just sent this transcript.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,710
So let me just, uh, show you how to,

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,670
Uh, to process this. So I first am done unloading this as

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,590
Microsoft docs. Now let me open it.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,990
And by the way, I want

10
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:41,290
to,

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,540
At this point, so,

12
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:54,340
because Powell sounded, I need to say that it's done,

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,840
But this is not what I wanted to show you. Um,

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,280
yeah, so I downloaded it. Let me to name it.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,190
I also want to quickly check what is the season seven episode

16
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:12,400
eight season seven,

17
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:15,010
episode eight. And,

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,750
uh, Of course from the

19
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:26,710
S E D S do You

20
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,080
just the short and now what we do is,

21
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,130
uh, Applaud to that and get that you

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,530
remember This transcript,

23
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,210
Um, and then just

24
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,980
a file, Upload it.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240
Okay. It is committed. Now we see,

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,030
or sometimes there is a delay,

27
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:09,530
but we see that now that is a check.

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,060
We go to action and to see now it is being executed.

29
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,250
Sometimes these things might turn with one minute delay or something

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,670
here. We got lucky. It was executed immediately.

31
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,270
You see, it's already a green check,

32
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,650
So it would go to a transcript.

33
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,340
So we're not interested where actually we'll also need to think what's right.

34
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,300
So I know we need this one.

35
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,590
Um, this one goes to YouTube To

36
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,010
you. You already know that Because he already so hard to do this.

37
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,210
Um, yeah,

38
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,600
this one and it's

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:07,990
<v 1>Okay,

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,260
But this is not the main thing I wanted to show you because I

41
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,170
show you sound speeds. And these big coming from

42
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,690
dating, saying science, debate engineering.

43
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,930
So now let me crawl and then I will just click Selecto.

44
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,960
Can I do this? Well, we'll just do control a to select all you

45
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,020
see, I selected the entire thing,

46
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,940
So I copy. And now I go to,

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,430
Um, a website, the website,

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,140
I go to podcasts, And

49
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:56,190
then you find the podcast. So remember,

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,950
this is a season seven,

51
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,630
episode eight. So we find season

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,210
seven, episode eight from data science, data engineering.

53
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,620
And I click this pencil, this pile,

54
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,860
And just then I take this thing

55
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,720
that I copied. So I press control and now

56
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm press paste and just to control it.

57
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,660
So it basically,

58
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,450
I couldn't come in changes.

59
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,990
No, this should update the website.

60
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,410
So, you know, it has been executed. So in a minute,

61
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,830
we should have the transcript.

62
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,100
Okay. Say this already. Let me just,

63
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,910
I'm just checking that the chapters and the chapters

64
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,880
are here, but of course in this,

65
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,200
Yeah, it is still being executed, man.

66
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,670
Mentor finish.

67
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,640
Well, it's doing this. Let me open this page and then

68
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:27,410
I'll just finish it. What cost they

69
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:27,950
spawn

70
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,910
It is being deployed.

71
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,740
Yeah. Okay.

72
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,900
Now we'll have transcript. So this is how we add transcripts to,

73
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,390
um, To a podcast event page

74
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,910
that we already have existing.

75
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,560
So this is called.
