1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,170
Yeah. So I, uh, created,

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,670
uh, so I decided to use the same thing cause we use for book

3
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:12,550
of the week and go away for book of the week.

4
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:14,890
So I just put this data match book here and here,

5
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:19,600
the handle and people started already

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,050
writing. So when I click on messages,

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,140
so it actually doesn't show up like a thing here.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,900
Like you need to click on messages and then there is message requests.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,870
So I click on this messaging question and this is one of the,

10
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:36,070

11
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:38,740
