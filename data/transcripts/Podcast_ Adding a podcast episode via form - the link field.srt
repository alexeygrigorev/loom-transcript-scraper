1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,950
Okay. Yeah. So just edit this field with links and

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,170
here for this one. So go to the YouTube video there.

3
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:14,340
We already have links or this is actually the same as we have.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,380
Uh, let's say here.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,970
Yeah. So these things for examples is at the same links and we have,

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,290
these links should be the same everywhere, so let's make copy them.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,890
And so just copy them on here from a

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,240
very video and then put them here.

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,550
Uh, the forum. No,

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,070
not this one. Yeah. And then

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,660
this one would be more for this one and to make it easier for

12
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:55,540
me to parse at this thing.

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,270
So what can make it larger? So that the name of the link then,

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,680
uh, the side and then the actual link and

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,590
the same here. So this way I will be able to,

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,340
uh, parse this information here that you provide.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,070
And then of course, don't forget the line break.

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,010
So let's say if there are three links, then it will be no link,

19
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,730
link, pity title.

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,500
And then I launched B um,

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,380
link three column something.

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,850
So follow this format. And then,

23
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:46,540
uh, this way I will be able to pass this information from the form

24
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,430
and put this as a webpage.
