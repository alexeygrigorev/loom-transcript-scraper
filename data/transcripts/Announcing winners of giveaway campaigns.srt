22
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,430
but for now I'll just click on feed and people

23
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,680
will get notified and they will start,

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,780

You will see it. I will show you so you will need to periodically

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,930
check this and see if there are,

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,370
if emails are sent to us and collect this email somewhere,

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,760
and you can create a spreadsheet or something like this. And once you have

31
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:55,410
like four, four or five emails, you send it to Kevin.

32
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,990
You probably remember the email chain I started.

33
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,220
Let's say it was, um, that mesh.

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,590
<v 1>Yeah, this email chain you are here already.

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,410
So you can just send the list of emails here.

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,930
So that's all. Yup.
