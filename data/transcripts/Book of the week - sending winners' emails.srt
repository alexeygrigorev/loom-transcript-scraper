00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,090
I received the last email. You sent

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:09,120
me the email, so now I will.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,010
Thanks. So then I paste it here and

4
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:23,460
now with emails, what I will do is send them to the author since

5
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,610
with a memo, we communicate.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,430
Hold on. Yeah.

7
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:37,170
I wanted to quit check my taste profile that I just

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,180
do communicating

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,520
through LinkedIn. Maybe we should've done this through email and

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,700
now I just came in

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,240
or

12
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,620
in a typical fluid

13
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,090
emails, the nurse, please send them.

14
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,650
Thanks.

15
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,910
This is how I send emails to others.

16
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,340
Well, usually this is publishers, but stay in space and book this self published.

17
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,790
And for publishers, they usually send it to a publisher.

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,090
Maybe I can show you usually it.

19
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:48,620
Oops.

20
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,250
For example, my conducted.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,130
Yeah. So based on the emails.

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,570
Yeah. So this is how it looks like sometimes there is author in the

23
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:19,270
copy as well, sometimes. And then I say that I shoot things

24
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,520
again. And then I say,

25
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,830
yeah, and that's,

26
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,930
that's how I address.
