1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,330
The announcement about the book was published.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,960
It was published for some reasons it's this

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,020
thing here, even the way I ask it to.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,990
So I review,

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,450
so it looks a bit cleaner and yeah,

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,540
of course this, uh, uh, the most important thing,

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,960
but it goes at a freestyle,

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,830
so people can start asking questions after I make announcements.

9
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:39,120
And then usually I remove the preview it later,

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,610
and I'm also making an announcement. So clicking on this share

11
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,100
message. Think peers.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,510
Yeah. When you just hover over the message to share message,

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,970
then I see channel announcement and then join

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,500
the week

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,430
or so sometime

16
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,190
in course, two announcement.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,370
Yeah. So this is how I post the announcement.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,230
So people know about the week. Think not everyone knows about this because

19
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,300
you see somebody 3000 people,

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,150
not 12,000. So it's Miami it's announcement and now people

21
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:38,010
will see it and they send us mail or some questions.
