1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,906
Uhm, so I just wanted to show you what to do when there is

2
00:00:03,926 --> 00:00:05,930
no subtitle, sometimes it happens,

3
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:08,837
you will have seen with workshops,

4
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:13,109
webinars So, also podcasts,

5
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,554
sometimes there is no subtitle,

6
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:18,379
right? And then I usually need to come up with something,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,185
so this is what I do So I,

8
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:24,115
uhm copy this,

9
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:29,224
the entire thing and then I go, I go to chargepd and I

10
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:34,720
put suggest then title for

11
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:39,628
this workshop and then uhm workshop,

12
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:45,598
you can replace workshop with podcast interview or webinar and then

13
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:53,447
I'll see what happens. it comes up with uh

14
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:58,276
yeah, I'll do an up-to-date

15
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:01,476
track with DLT. So then this is something you can send me,

16
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:05,856
for example, or I think 10 maybe is too much.

17
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,776
Let's use 10 titles for this workshop.

18
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,868
And then this is something you can send to me,

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,137
right, so you can say, okay, this thing doesn't

20
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:25,944
have a subtitle, but here are the suggestions from JudgePT.

21
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:36,870
Oops. And then, uh.

22
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,232
We can look in Scalable Datas Pipeline.

23
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:50,160
Could be something like this. Right.

24
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:54,488
So, this is what you can do when there is no subtitle or there

25
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:58,096
is no title. You can, uh, send me already some options.

26
00:01:58,436 --> 00:02:01,916
And if you don't have a ChargePT account, you can create one.

27
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:06,196
And this ChargePT 4.0 should be available on free plans.
