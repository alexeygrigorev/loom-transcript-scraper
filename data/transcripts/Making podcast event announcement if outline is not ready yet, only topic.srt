1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,000
so we want to show you how I create events when we on the

2
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:12,780
grid on the outline, but we have agreed on a title already,

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,680
so I'll go to heaven,

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,510
right? So this is the place where payments and

5
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:26,190
then, yeah. So since we don't have podcasts that are

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,890
opinion, so I need to go to restaurants.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,230
And then I says, come in data engineering manager.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,630
I copied

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,640
now with the way I need Chubb dated two March.

10
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,310
Um, and then here,

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,720
and this is the title from PSA and study engineering.

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,600
I thought about subtitle.

13
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,000
Maybe I'll think about this. I will not record this.

14
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,820
Um, yeah, we should have some more fun.

15
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,300
Yeah. So maybe,

16
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,360
um, maybe we'll just leave it to ask your name and then

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,430
we'll subtitle later, click copy.

18
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:43,470
Then this is March 11

19
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,740
and at time of courses 12

20
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,830
and yeah. So since we already purpose your biography,

21
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,220
I'm not sure if personal website and Peter was intended to be as a

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,950
part of the biography. Well,

23
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:22,310
at least we can do this for day one since she's standard.

24
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,310
And then when we actually create a profile,

25
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,110
for sure, I'll do a separate video about

26
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,350
that. Okay.

27
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:39,980
And then I'll client a to be announced

28
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,440
and yeah, I'll need to update that.

29
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,670
But the main thing I wanted to show is that since we haven't

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,060
Seen school, if you haven't figured it out yet on the outline could say,

31
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,100
given, get the, that she likes to push us.

32
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,580
That's why there is no outline yet.

33
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,610
I usually kill it after we do the one questions.

34
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,610
That's why I will just pick an announcement because today I want to,

35
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,150
I'm preparing right now in this newsletter.

36
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,800
I'll talk about this little newsletter later,

37
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,190
but I need to feel this whence section.

38
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,770
And that's why I just want to have a place folder.

39
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:35,890
So people can only start to do this thing months later.

40
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,710
Okay. With, with actual details.

41
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,940
Yeah. Okay. That's all. Uh, I will know.

42
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:51,860
Um, I will now put image

43
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,090
appropriate. I'll do something quick and then I will ask you to replace it

44
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:59,450
with a good one from Canada. Okay.

45
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:00,860
That's it. So here's one.
