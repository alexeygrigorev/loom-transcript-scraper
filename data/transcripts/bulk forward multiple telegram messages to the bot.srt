1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,350
Um, hello. I wanted to show you,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,410
I don't know how to do it from the web,

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,310
but in mobile version of telegram,

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,830
you can forward multiple messages.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,930
So let's say, um, so I sent you a bunch of things,

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,270
right? So then I just,

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,050
I think you just need to hold it. You see, I hold and then

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,610
I can select so I can select multiple things.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,220
Um, well,

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,960
up to this point, right? So I selected multiple messages

11
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:46,520
that I sent, and then you can just click forward and

12
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,680
then two to do two, these two,

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,350
right. And then I click send and you see that's all

14
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:58,220
the messages now to do, do think.

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,990
Oh Yeah.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,800
Okay. I just wanted to check that and this

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,110
lower, So,

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,570
So corporately. Yeah, here it has all this things.

19
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,590
Oh no. So probably something useful.

20
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,910
You can balk a forward and bunch of events,

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,910
a bunch of messages from me to the boat,

22
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,590
and then we'll be edit. I don't know how

23
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,840
to do this from a bio. Probably. It's also possible.

24
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,310
Maybe you can figure that out.
