00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,960
Hi, I think, yeah, I think we should redo this a little bit.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,670
Cause I think they don't really care about the overall number of clicks in

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:13,290
the newsletter. They more care about the number of clicks on their

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:17,100
content. So I prepared this,

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,870
a template that you should use so I can break down and

6
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:27,780
then let's do it in together. So go to MailChimp and

7
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:32,790
then in MailChimp. So no

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,750
open that campaign, that campaign with this

9
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:43,890
one, it was the last week.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,280
And here we have the number of links. I

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,190
actually like huge the total number of

12
00:00:56,191 --> 00:01:00,990
this. I think they don't really care if it's

13
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,760
a, what's the number.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,770
So it doesn't matter if it's a, maybe we can say X,

15
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,960
uh, nah,

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,800
I don't think they really care. They just care the number of clicks coming

17
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,940
from the newsletter. And we have it here and say,

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,640
we can take here what links.

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,970
Yeah. So this is basically

20
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,890
the percentage, just total number.

21
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,990
So that's the number then we need to feel in

22
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,270
this one clicks in theater. So let's go to,

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,620
and then Twitter I'll quote you or data co-op account.

24
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,500
It was one week ago, right?

25
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,950
So tweet analytics and we had 11 clicks

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,560
and let's see LinkedIn.

27
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,180
So,

28
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,340
and this one probably did a little better.

29
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,940
So let's see. I'll do actually see this.

30
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,970
Maybe we need to remember that

31
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:43,960
these sticks here,

32
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,750
there was a way to actually Lucas.

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,550
It doesn't seem like this.

34
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,680
Hmm. Yeah.

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,640
I don't know how to check and also try to find it.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,540
Yeah. It used to be possible. Like there was some sort of hidden

37
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,810
somewhere, I guess. So now, um,

38
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,130
I'll find it.
