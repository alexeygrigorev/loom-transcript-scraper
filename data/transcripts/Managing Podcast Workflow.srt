1
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:04,533
So it looks like the one with Christopher was the last one.

2
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:08,015
So here in the podcast document, in the podcast folder.

3
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:13,819
And also please record it somewhere so we don't lose this information.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,301
So here in this folder, so Dropbox podcast.

5
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:19,903
I think I have, you have access to that.

6
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:26,528
So first when we have, when our podcast

7
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:30,790
interview goes live. I also record it on my on my computer.

8
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,372
So not only on YouTube, but also on my computer.

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:38,836
And then at the end, when I stop, at the end of the

10
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:44,420
interview, I get some files and I upload these files to this podcast

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,482
folder, right? And if we open,

12
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:50,664
let's say,

13
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:56,468
this one with Christopher. So when I open

14
00:00:56,528 --> 00:01:00,160
it, let me just check through the entire thing with you.

15
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,722
Right now, um,

16
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:04,953
okay, reach out to guests. It's clear.

17
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:08,095
Agree on a date. Create a document with question for the podcast.

18
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:12,578
Share the podcast document on the DTC podcast help.

19
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,660
Create a calendar invite. Ask the guests.

20
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:19,343
I think this is clear, right? So maybe even,

21
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:26,468
let me open it. So,

22
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,029
agree on a date, create a calendar invite,

23
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,481
this is something we can do.

24
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:34,703
Um,

25
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:37,955
here, so once we agree on a date,

26
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:41,587
we immediately, we can even, uh,

27
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:46,281
uh, wait, once

28
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:49,893
we agree on a date, we probably already have a document with questions.

29
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:54,987
Uh, this is the podcast document that we'll later share with Johanna.

30
00:01:57,428 --> 00:02:00,020
It's not moved yet, right? Or you updated the links already?

31
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:05,062
By the way, how is it going with the migration project?

32
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:09,946
Anyways, um, so we create a calendar invite,

33
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,468
share the podcast document on the DDC podcast help,

34
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,483
and also, um,

35
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,585
wait, because, um,

36
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:26,637
this is one thing, but what we can also do is share,

37
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:31,863
we can include Johanna to our project.

38
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:37,354
Our conversation, include Johanna

39
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:44,279
or somebody else who helps with

40
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:48,902
the questions in

41
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:52,705
the email thread. So typically it's Johanna,

42
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:58,809
but maybe it's for some, it could be somebody

43
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,060
else. worse

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,964
So once we agreed on a document,

45
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:21,270
we can already include Johanna there and start preparing

46
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,076
questions. Ask the guest a biography and other information.

47
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:31,751
So this is something we put to the podcast document.

48
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:34,833
Ask the guest the bio to the podcast document.

49
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,916
Agree with author on the title and the outline.

50
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:44,020
Fill in the people form. Okay. So this is something on Data Talks

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,722
Club. When we create events,

52
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:50,365
we have these links. You already know that.

53
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,328
So this is why we need to create the,

54
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:57,160
wait, where is it?

55
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:07,474
Oh, here we Create a banner for

56
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,636
podcast event in Enigma. Okay. Create an event in Luma.

57
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:15,840
Create an event in the

58
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:20,383
community calendar. I think I

59
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:24,906
asked you to update this. So please check, please make sure that in other

60
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,609
that in other templates we also So,

61
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,092
call it DTC Community. Community calendar.

62
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:36,574
Yeah, right. This is what I meant.

63
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:40,257
Because like it could be confusing. We have here create a calendar invite,

64
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:43,019
right? And here we have create an event,

65
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,961
right? So it could be confusing. What's the difference between these two?

66
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:50,944
So this is for guests and this is for the attendees.

67
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:55,087
And first, yeah, we have to have a Luma event.

68
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:58,760
Create an event in Meetup, announce the event in Slack.

69
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:10,434
And here is a to-do for you. Add the link to the document.

70
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:16,819
Check if there's also a to-do doc.

71
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,001
Create an event on LinkedIn. This is something we discussed.

72
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:23,005
We need to update it. Fill in the event form on their table.

73
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:26,788
Add the event to the DataDocs group web page.

74
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:30,880
Schedule post on tiktok and twitter.

75
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,091
I think this is something we talked about already.

76
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:35,813
So instead of creating an event,

77
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:41,777
this is what we need to do. So I will remove

78
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:44,059
it.

79
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,382
So this one, I don't think we do it.

80
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:51,724
Wait. I don't think we do it anymore.

81
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,529
so we can just forget about that. Remind the guest about the event one

82
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:01,630
week before, one week day before,

83
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:04,712
actual stream. So here you don't need to do anything.

84
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:09,095
It's just after it's done, you tick the box and you put,

85
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,658
so every time you do something like,

86
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,460
for example, create a podcast document, you add a link here.

87
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,522
Then when you create a meetup link, you add a link here.

88
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:23,485
Don't do a link to it anymore.

89
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:26,787
Meetup link, YouTube link, podcast link.

90
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:37,244
here, it's Spotify

91
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:40,947
podcast link to do,

92
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:47,872
Apple podcasts link to

93
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:48,112
do.

94
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:54,367
Then what else, uh,

95
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:58,850
DVC web page podcast link to do.

96
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,112
And maybe there are some other links we should add here.

97
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:10,856
So then we have all the links here, and when you copy them,

98
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,278
when you create page,

99
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:16,860
you can also update this description,

100
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,502
so then it has other things.

101
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:22,864
Okay, uh, actual scripting,

102
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,586
add the YouTube link of the stream to the website,

103
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:30,189
update the recording to the shared folder in Dropbox.

104
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,812
This is what I showed you. So then you just check that it's,

105
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:40,326
when it's there, you tick the box, um,

106
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,697
you ask the guests for links after the stream, yeah,

107
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:46,560
so you just sent an email thanking them for the stream and then asking

108
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,053
if they want to share anything, then you edit the video,

109
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,665
uh, then the edit,

110
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,187
the editing on YouTube takes a bit of time,

111
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,829
so then sometimes we need to come there in like three,

112
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:02,471
four hours to check, yeah. If it's, it finished editing,

113
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,543
then actually I would update the cover,

114
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:08,225
uh, as soon as possible.

115
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:13,225
Uh,

116
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,702
we check if the video, add video to live stream and podcast playlist on

117
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:22,754
YouTube, uh, update, uh,

118
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:27,327
so then this is something to do. Uh, it

119
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:30,169
should be Luma, update the event sheet.

120
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,169
Ah,

121
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,944
yeah, this is the uploading.

122
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:47,951
When was the last time we actually did that?

123
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:56,307
It's been a while. Okay,

124
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:59,839
um, yeah, that's pity that we haven't done this in a while.

125
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,971
So I was thinking it's happening,

126
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:08,995
but it's not. Yeah,

127
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,998
so for now, let's not do that. Let's just keep this thing.

128
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,482
Podcast document to archive on Google Drive,

129
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:21,904
send the video to the freelancer. Um, okay,

130
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:26,528
so we don't do this anymore because the freelancer doesn't work with us anymore.

131
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:33,681
So you need to update this to, uh,

132
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,742
uh, edit it,

133
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,274
uh, create that transcript.

134
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,070
So please, uh, when you create that,

135
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:48,233
uh, when you create,

136
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:51,475
uh, the process document for that, um,

137
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:53,747
add it here. And this is actually, oops,

138
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:57,300
it's in our to-do list. So these two.

139
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,771
Uh, so these two are about creating,

140
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:16,025
um, transcriptions. Where

141
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:20,446
was I? Create the transcript.

142
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:25,028
So you turn that, uh, these Luma videos into process documents.

143
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:28,239
Update the podcast freelancers. Preach it.

144
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:37,070
Um, so let's see what is there. So

145
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,631
here we don't do paid transcript anymore.

146
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:40,972
We just, uh, yeah,

147
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,487
I guess we don't keep track of that anymore.

148
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:56,678
Uh, yeah,

149
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,009
so this document is needed to keep track of,

150
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,820
uh, um,

151
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:03,861
edits. So when we send a podcast,

152
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:08,454
uh, so for transcripts, we don't do it

153
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:11,186
anymore. So let me just delete this,

154
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:16,080
uh, or status transcript.

155
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:18,321
So you just mark it as done when it finishes.

156
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:21,193
So for a new events, um,

157
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,616
so please, uh, check with Dave for how many more episodes,

158
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:28,238
um, we,

159
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,749
um, mark it as done.

160
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,913
know, so what we are going to do right now is we

161
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:40,456
will, um, start from scratch here.

162
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:46,600
So I will, um, let me just

163
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:51,183
delete all these things. I'll just,

164
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:56,183
yeah.

165
00:11:57,227 --> 00:12:00,769
So when we have a new episode,

166
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,840
let's start with three stuff. I'll show you how to fill it in.

167
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,920
And please make sure everything is documented. I know it's a lot of information

168
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:12,520
for you right now, and you work only for 15 hours per week right

169
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:16,300
now, but please make sure that this information does not slip through the cracks,

170
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,180
and we have it documented somewhere.

171
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,420
I'm pretty sure there should be a process document for that somewhere.

172
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:25,980
So let's try to find it,

173
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,980
and yeah,

174
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,152
and somehow we also, need to make sure that we can find an easy

175
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:39,215
way to find this information. Okay,

176
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:43,157
so I was here.

177
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,441
Then we add the video.

178
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:57,667
And status in progress. You will do it soon.

179
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:02,380
Status identity is done. and then please,

180
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:07,894
Let's ask Dave for how many more edits

181
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:12,677
or how many more podcast episodes we paid.

182
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:18,741
So this is yes. And then you

183
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:23,684
just include yes, yes, yes for how many more we paid because

184
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:25,766
we want to keep track of the payments.

185
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:31,790
And I will typically include you like when I make a new payment to

186
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,322
Dave. You will just, usually we pay for four.

187
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:38,584
So when we run out of payments, you will just add yes,

188
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:43,578
yes, yes. And wait, what's happening? And here

189
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,970
uh date paid.

190
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,193
So here we, you can ask him hey when was the last invoice paid

191
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:56,147
and for how many how many unedited episodes we still have in our um

192
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,399
pipeline. So then you can feel this thing.

193
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,131
And then next time we pay. We will

194
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:06,734
also put it here. So I just want to keep track of,

195
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:11,798
so the reason this spreadsheet exists is we want to keep track of how

196
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:15,901
many things we paid for and for how and when we need to pay

197
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,463
again. So, yeah,

198
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:23,447
that's why it's here. Include

199
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:26,880
encodes extracted from the transcript.

200
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:37,252
Okay, yeah, so for that we need to,

201
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:39,704
I want to update it to,

202
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:51,002
uh, open the

203
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:54,124
transcript, uh, save it, upload it to transcript utils, add file,

204
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:56,706
commit changes, yeah, this is right,

205
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:59,948
and then you get the time codes on time. Also,

206
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,420
please, for this one, check with Valeria if we need to.

207
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:05,702
We need to, uh,

208
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:11,236
update it. Schedulated

209
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:14,758
podcast with Anchor, so right now it's called Spotify for podcasters,

210
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:17,160
and we need to update it.

211
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:23,784
It's also to-do for you, so we need to update it with Spotify

212
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:28,087
for podcasters. So Anchor is the old name for that,

213
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,208
so they rebranded it and changed the interface.

214
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,852
add a podcast episode with the air table form.

215
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:41,637
So this is something that happens between,

216
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:45,079
as I mentioned, there is a task that needs to happen between the time

217
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:47,921
the podcast episode is released and the newsletter.

218
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,043
So by then we have everything,

219
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,086
and by the way Schedule.

220
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:58,599
So here in the schedule we have,

221
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,599
so

222
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:09,921
uh

223
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,958
um no so this one is not right.

224
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:23,344
So here we just have the link to Google and that's enough.

225
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:29,758
So the reason this thing exists is we keep track of uh

226
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,330
Release. So please find the relevant process document

227
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,970
and update them. So here we keep track of things

228
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,210
when we release podcast episodes, right?

229
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:53,590
So for example, last week we had um this.

230
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,990
Please write the the full name here,

231
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:58,030
the full name of the full title.

232
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,870
And then it was season 18,

233
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,812
episode number 9. So here we keep track of what is the season,

234
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:08,694
what is the episode. And then next time we publish something,

235
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:12,416
we would write here. So ideally we should have a plan here,

236
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:15,799
right? So this is podcast release.

237
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:20,001
So 16th of August was last week. This is when we published the episode

238
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:22,463
with Chris, right? And then next week, for example,

239
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:25,325
yeah we need to move Ella here.

240
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:29,188
But like once we have a new think with Rachel.

241
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:34,110
It will probably take two weeks. So here Rachel is this is when we

242
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:36,610
release it as a audio only version.

243
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,110
And it will be season 19 episode one,

244
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,490
right? And then after Rachel it will be Anne. It's 19.2,

245
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,430
right? So here we want to know and you need to put the full

246
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:53,870
name here of course. But here we just know okay now we have the

247
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:56,630
episodes in pipeline. Right,

248
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,010
and this is how you know season and episode number,

249
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,071
and then anchor your URL. This is actually Spotify for

250
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:08,672
podcasters URL. YouTube, Apple Podcasts,

251
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:13,294
Spotify. I don't know if this Spotify for podcasters still have,

252
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,598
I think the anchor thing still exists.

253
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,919
Yeah. Okay,

254
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:32,150
we need to figure out what kind of link to put there.

255
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:44,234
Okay. Schedule, create a podcast page,

256
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:48,228
uh, fill in the newsletter announcement.

257
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:52,892
This is exactly what you need to do on over the weekend after the

258
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:55,344
podcast episode is released. Right now, uh,

259
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:58,497
there is nothing to publish I think, so yeah,

260
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:01,490
that's why I, we don't need Too high with that one.

261
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:06,062
Then after it's created,

262
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:08,304
yeah, we ask the guest to share the podcast page,

263
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:11,177
add the link to the podcast page to the newsletter.

264
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:15,871
Uh, what is the difference between

265
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:18,834
these two?

266
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:26,070
Book of the week, like it's not even right.

267
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Um,

268
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:42,416
yeah, we need to, I think this is actually what we,

269
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:48,700
come on, what's why it's book of the week?

270
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:53,734
Like please find a relevant process document and if you cannot,

271
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,085
uh, we need to create a new one.

272
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:59,237
So the idea behind these two is we need to,

273
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:03,380
um, we already We have a placeholder.

274
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:08,193
In the, um, in the newsletter, and now we need

275
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:10,235
to fill it in with actual information.

276
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,676
So please coordinate with Valeria about this too,

277
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:16,779
and let's make sure everything is documented. Okay.

278
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:19,651
I understand that it's a lot of information probably will take,

279
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,732
uh, you will spend the next week,

280
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,514
uh, on that once you finish the,

281
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,746
uh, the thing with taxes,

282
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:30,268
but let's make this a priority. I want you to be able to do

283
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:34,151
the entire thing end to end. And for that, I'll we will need to

284
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,892
work on updating the process documents.

285
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:39,804
Yeah. So please make it a priority for the next week.

286
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:44,187
Uh, schedule post overview after the event and linked it.

287
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,289
Uh,

288
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:50,582
okay. Um, and yeah,

289
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:55,325
maybe you can also, let me see what is

290
00:20:55,345 --> 00:20:55,485
here.

291
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:09,842
yeah, maybe ask Valeria what this is.

292
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:14,425
Because it has to be a process document and what

293
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:16,677
we have from Valeria is not that.

294
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:22,912
Uh, but I think here is

295
00:21:22,972 --> 00:21:27,455
the template, right? Yeah,

296
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:30,558
please ask her what exactly we need to do here and then we can

297
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:33,440
make a proper process document from the library.

298
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:39,135
Please. Okay, so I think it gives you a good overview of,

299
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:45,080
I think we also need to, what we call AnchorFM,

300
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,684
AnchorLink. We need to figure out what is now we have instead of Anchor,

301
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:55,589
Spotify for Podcasters link. Actually,

302
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:57,200
check it.

303
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,491
Now, maybe there is no specific link for this thing anymore.

304
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,213
Okay, so it's,

305
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:26,998
is there a link?

306
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,990
Oh, this is not right. Like,

307
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,822
this is not what you would in episode description. So please check the,

308
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,984
uh,

309
00:22:41,004 --> 00:22:43,216
please check what we should put there. Like there is,

310
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:47,509
it's, it used to be called anchor. So you want to check the podcast,

311
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,982
uh, the process documents for anchor and then check what we have there.

312
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:54,764
And, uh, yeah, so this is not,

313
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:59,007
this is not right. Explicit content?

314
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:01,549
Of course, no. Like, why?

315
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,533
Yeah, please make sure you read the process documents before you do that.

316
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,214
Like, we don't want to have the improvisation here,

317
00:23:10,615 --> 00:23:13,797
right? So, like, the process documents exist for a reason and if you don't

318
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:16,038
know how to do something, just let me know, okay?

319
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:24,284
Like, please don't improvise. And

320
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:28,847
so I think I don't know

321
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:33,370
how to get the link right now for a podcast episode.

322
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,491
Let me see.

323
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:44,796
Does this thing still exist? Yeah, okay.

324
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,939
So, you go to this thing, podcasterspotify.com, podshow,

325
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,721
DataDocsClub, and then you get the link from here.

326
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,824
Oops, see more.

327
00:23:56,064 --> 00:24:00,468
Like, how do we actually, Yeah,

328
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:03,940
so when we just click on this, I think we get the,

329
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:07,813
link to the actual thing. So, this is what I meant by the,

330
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:13,517
by the link. So, for example, I will now go to,

331
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:17,660
I'll call it anchor instead of anchor.

332
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,983
Spotify for podcasters link.

333
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:28,828
Save. And then for Chris, where is it?

334
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:40,130
Chris. it's

335
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:44,474
here. Save.

336
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:48,537
Okay.

337
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:56,744
And this was actually after event, so now we need to put this here.

338
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:03,530
So with this one, we'll, we also need to do it to finish these

339
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:06,852
things, but let's later, once you figure out like the priority for next week,

340
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,574
we will be figuring out the podcast thing.

341
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:14,097
Right. And we'll do

342
00:25:14,117 --> 00:25:16,348
the same thing now afterwards with other,

343
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:20,561
um, other things. What is podcast example?

344
00:25:25,684 --> 00:25:27,886
Okay, I think Valeria maybe was experimenting with.

345
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:34,310
And this is something you created, right? Okay,

346
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,982
good. We can,

347
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:39,654
uh, make it a template.

348
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:49,020
Okay. So, uh, this was the podcast.

349
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,343
Yeah. There are a lot of things and it's outdated.

350
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:57,506
I know, not ideal, but then coming back to this one.

351
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,468
So usually after the episode is edited,

352
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,400
I delete, um, like let's say we keep Last few.

353
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:06,692
But like these ones are pretty old,

354
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:12,255
so I will remove them. So every now,

355
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:16,158
like every month we can come to this folder to clean things we don't

356
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:20,681
need anymore. And when you upload

357
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:23,693
something to, um,

358
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:26,095
Spotify for podcasters, uh,

359
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:28,566
you move things here to the uploaded folder.

360
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:33,469
So if it's not documented anywhere, please also document this and the structure of

361
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,653
this folder. So here when we don't have any anything

362
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,975
here, it means that we don't have any episodes in the pipeline.

363
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:46,328
Let me keep just in case, uh,

364
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:50,021
the edited version for the last one. But every now and then we clean

365
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,943
it. So here's the structure of our podcast document.

366
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,545
So here we have unedited things, here we have edited things,

367
00:26:56,645 --> 00:27:01,488
and every time we upload something, we schedule with Spotify for podcasters,

368
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:04,550
we put it to there.

369
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:06,953
Okay,

370
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:11,798
that is a lot, uh, so please make sure everything

371
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,801
I shared with you is documented somewhere. I know it takes time,

372
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,063
but we're not in a rush anywhere.

373
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:22,609
Please take time to document everything, and let's make sure this information

374
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:23,240
is not lost.
