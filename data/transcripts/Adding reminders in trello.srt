1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,550
Oh, hi, sorry. I started the free trial or Trello.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,010
So with this free trial, um,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,380
with premium, um, we can add reminders for specific

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,050
items of in checklist like this one.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,790
Um, like if mine two bought, they went on Wednesday.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,380
So I said it to today because today's Wednesday before the event.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,340
So to make sure we do not forget, um, we will do that.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,040
Um, so for example, this one, so select winners,

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,000
so this should kept them on next Friday.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,410
So the reminder here, and you see that there is a reminder,

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,970
so this way we do not forget to actually do this.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,960
And I edit these things.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,640
You see the first element of the checklist is reminders to the checklist

14
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,640
items and the way we will use it.

15
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,280
So let's say I want to create a new book

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,400
and it will be some,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,220
some book. All right.

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,670
So this is not the real book. I just want to show you what

19
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:19,530
you need to do. The moment you create a from

20
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:24,000
the template. So you create a card and yeah,

21
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,540
you have this first item. What do you need to do to,

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,550
to check it is you need to set a reminder to

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,950
this one. So it will be,

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,550
let's say this is,

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,770
um, let's say if we want to do this book for I'll

26
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:50,280
take 28, March 28th

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,270
March.

28
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,590
So then the minder.

29
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,570
So if it's 28 March, so the reminder should go on 21st of March.

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,090
So this is a Wednesday before they went.

31
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,490
And then another reminder will be this one selected on Friday.

32
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,190
So on Friday or event week,

33
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,680
I think for this one, that's sold the ones, I think at the reminder

34
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:29,470
for the next item, we don't need this anymore.

35
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,480
Well, I will say the more from the template.

36
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,590
So for the book of the week, I think these are the two things

37
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:43,780
you need to have a reminder and

38
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:48,700
also invite the author, but something also you shouldn't do on Wednesday,

39
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,920
but because this thing has a reminder,

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,160
um, yeah, I think it's kind of clear that I don't think

41
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,930
you need to set reminders for both of these things.

42
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,000
Um,

43
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,110
Yeah, maybe this one for Monday,

44
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,430
maybe it's a good idea to also set the reminder.

45
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,500
So let's say this is 28. So basically

46
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:22,060
every thing that requires a particular Dean should have a due

47
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,940
date to make sure you do not forget this.

48
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,520
You can also assign it to yourself, for example.

49
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:39,200
Yeah. And this way we don't forget. And I think I wanted to remove

50
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,420
this thing that reminder.

51
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,230
Yeah, we do not need this because we now will be able to set

52
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:47,750
reminders for each item.

53
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,440
So I don't think,

54
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,230
and then the same thing for podcast. So let's say podcast

55
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,870
and this podcast is, uh,

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,900
let's say also for, uh,

57
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,030
I'll go with first of

58
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,550
All, first of all,

59
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,030
On some topics on guests. Okay. The card.

60
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,480
And then the first thing here is reminders is

61
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,820
a reminder,

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,740
oh, sorry. Do you mind to the guests about the event one week before

63
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:37,310
they went? So we, if this is for the 1st of April,

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,120
then we send a reminder set reminder one week before,

65
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,370
and then we set the mind that are one day before and

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,030
yeah, actually what else?

67
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,790
Um, we, we need in winder.

68
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,400
Yeah. Maybe after the stream, we can figure

69
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,590
out where exactly we need to set reminders.

70
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,610
Um, at least four for

71
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,200
these two

72
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,040
To make sure they don't forget. And then the same thing for the webinar.

73
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,910
Right? So this is, we've got these two things we need to send a

74
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,240
reminder one week before and one day before.

75
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,610
So this is what I wanted to show you. This is how we add

76
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:39,180
reminders to our Trello card.
