1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,210
Um, so the speaker moved the event.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,260
So now I want to show, how will we move them up?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,590
So there will be an event today, but we decided to move it to

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,500
March. So for that, what I do is first day,

5
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:20,650
I did this on Eventbrite. So I go to click on this and

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,030
it takes forever to load. Okay. Now basic

7
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:29,360
basically I think this is where I set the date.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,840
Yeah. And here in basic info,

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,980
we'll change it to March. So this is the date where,

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,780
uh, where we're mood. So it's 1st of March 5:00 PM as well.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,320
Um, okay, so now  got

12
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,540
adjusted automatically. If it's not,

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,330
we need to adjust mine. Then I click save.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,210
So that is sufficient for Eventbrite.

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,440
Then we need to do the same or meet up to go to meet

16
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:13,360
up. Then this is a Steven today that we need to change.

17
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,720
So those are tools.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,160
Uh, and then again,

19
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,980
there's choose a different, I chose a different date here.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,150
1st of March. I don't think I need to change anything else here.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,970
Should I just click save changes? Then one other thing is

22
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,070
I also need to adjust it in the calendar.

23
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,490
So it is a public calendar that people use for

24
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:48,340
subscribing to the events.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,770
So this is the event that we have in the Google calendar and here

26
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,820
in Devon, who also need to change the lead it's 1st of March,

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,000
you see it can get adjusted automatically.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,930
So everything safe and subscribe to this cousin that will also have that.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,610
So I think we can see that now it's here.

30
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,060
And yeah, so,

31
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,820
uh, this event, I didn't announce it on LinkedIn.

32
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,750
So that's why, um, if it was announced on LinkedIn and we would need

33
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:23,140
to edit it there as well. So here we will not need this.

34
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,500
And then the last thing we need to adjust it to the website.

35
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,100
So on the website, it says the 1st of February,

36
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,620
so we need to edit this. That is the link,

37
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,050
this get up pages. We need to click on this link.

38
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,260
So we will have a different version of a website in some time,

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,120
but now this is what he use. So maybe when there is a different

40
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,960
version now for the Curtis, a different video right now.

41
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,710
Yeah. We need to go to data. Then there is this events,

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,980
the TMO, and I need to click it.

43
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:10,000
So here, this events for February are here actually.

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,720
So they can also need to put them this ones.

45
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,870
So this is actually in January.

46
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:21,640
So what would it, yeah, just

47
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:23,740
to keep it a little bit more organized,

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,580
then the events for February are,

49
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:35,170
so this one is a little bit here and

50
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:39,850
then there are no events for March. So now move it a little

51
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,070
bit. So create a section here,

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,080
court, March, and then I will edit there and then I will

53
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,750
change two to three. Okay.

54
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,270
So ideally this is all you need to do.

55
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,270
Six year. I did a bit of arrangement typically.

56
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,730
I don't think you would need to say to that. Um,

57
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,130
so here it just changed the date. Um,

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,440
I don't need to change anything else here.

59
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,780
Now, when I scroll all the way down and

60
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,520
then just click can be changes.

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,190
And then now you trued out my declare update to the website.

62
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,650
So if I go to two actions that we'll see that you

63
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:23,760
see right now in this, there is a task of updating the website.

64
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,290
So it's cute Tinder cure.

65
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah. Now it's running. So it's doing some technical things that are not

66
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:35,040
important, but yeah, the important thing it's,

67
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,230
it's a progress. Then it takes

68
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:42,630
a, as you see one minute, 10 seconds,

69
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,990
oh, slightly more than one minute to,

70
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,560
uh, for this to change. So you play at eight now.

71
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,420
It will not be changed still. So it needs a bit of time.

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,050
Okay. It's still in progress. I think it needs a couple more seconds.

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,260
Can click on this actually to see what's going on. Yeah.

74
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,840
So it has finished. So now it's doing this employee to stop.

75
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,410
Yeah. So once we have D*** here in the website should be outdated and

76
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,110
she is doing the point.

77
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,770
Oh cool.

78
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,110
And now I can just reload it. And I see that this

79
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:28,210
thing moved to 1st of March.

80
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,540
So this is how you move the events. Uh,

81
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,670
you speak your, uh,

82
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,560
MOOCs, uh, the .
