1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,880
Um, I see that he already saw this document.

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:05,370
I just wanted to show you what is here.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,550
So here in this document data, those clubs kiddo,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,810
we have, uh, well, this is a calendar with all the things.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,900
So thirst, let me start with this column.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,090
So this is the book of the week events,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,730
and this is, uh, these are the everyday events that we have here in

8
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,120
this, uh, top in this,

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,860
uh, page. Um,

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,530
so this one already,

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,390
uh, it announce, so I usually,

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,500
well, I forgot about this, uh, this guy actually didn't drop,

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,150
so we didn't agree with him on anything. Maybe I will put it to

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,810
follow up.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,640
So this is the first thing.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,690
Then we have webinars, the second column,

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,170
and here we have, uh, some of these dates. This is when the book

18
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:12,300
of the week thing happens. So it starts on a Monday

19
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:15,870
and then on Thursday. And you see,

20
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:20,430
we have them every two weeks before that you can see then before that

21
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:25,200
we had this every week now we have helped them less

22
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,140
frequently would be heightened.

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,950
Um, so we'll have one already that is planned,

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,450
but not announced yet. Uh, in the other video,

25
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:39,570
I show how to booze. Then we have another,

26
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,030
no another column here for webinars and we

27
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,400
have another column or podcasts.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,110
Um, and here, this is how I keep track of,

29
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,900
for, um, who we have,

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,240
um, uh, in the schedule,

31
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,900
but we haven't announced yet. And do you see here,

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,190
we have status, like it's announced in this Janine,

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:11,190
um, with Janine, we talked and we agreed to move it to 15th of March

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,220
um, so it means that we don't have a speaker for the next week,

35
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,740
which is a PD and this is the podcast.

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,070
So for podcasts, actually, there is a speaker for,

37
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,750
uh, for next week and I will add the same,

38
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:34,530
a separate, I will show how to now I do this in a separate

39
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,150
email, uh, in a separate video.
