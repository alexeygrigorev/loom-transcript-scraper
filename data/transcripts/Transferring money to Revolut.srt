1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,720
<affirmative>. Um, so we're running out of money on a Revolut account,

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,320
so Revolut, um, I typically use Revolut for online payment,

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,320
uh, because they don't have, um, like if I use Phenome,

4
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:13,560
there are some fees. Anyways, so there is,

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,120
uh, this Revolut account, and maybe you actually saw that recently there was

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,920
a transaction, MailChimp transaction.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,360
Uh, yeah, you see this from relu.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,880
Um, so now I want to,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,160
<v 1>Uh,

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,400
To move some money to Relu. So this is how I do it.

11
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:40,320
So first of all, we copy this is the bank account from Revolu,

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,120
and then I go to the main one and move some money there.

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,920
So that's probably, um,

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,200
no, it's already here. So I think what you should do instead is not

15
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,440
taking this, uh, Avon, but Right.

16
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,120
Alex, that's me. Yeah.

17
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:06,880
And this is the same. Oh, no, it's not the same actually.

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,560
Um,

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:18,920
yeah, we need to make sure that this is this one because,

20
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:22,200
um, like this one is business and the previous one was not business.

21
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:26,320
I think, um, probably we need to,

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,160
um, remove the old one. Okay. I want to move 3000 there and

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,000
yeah, just want to make sure it's the right one.

24
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,030
And I just pay now,

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,750
so I will ask you to do this sometimes.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,270
So let me confirm it.

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,910
Okay. So this is how you transfer money to our revenue account.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,490
Uh, let me check if I should or

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,330
Yeah, I'll do this offline. I'll don't need to record this.

30
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:10,850
I want to remove the other, uh,

31
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:14,450
my other account so it doesn't come up in search.

32
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,210
But yeah, so just in case copy Ivan,

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,650
when do this.
