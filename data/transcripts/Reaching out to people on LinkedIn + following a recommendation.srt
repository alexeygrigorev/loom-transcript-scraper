00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,650
Um, hi, I wanted to show you how I reach out to people.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,440
So, um, somebody recommended your ex-colleague

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,100
and I wanted to invite him.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,000
So what could I do is say from this link?

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,800
So it's in LinkedIn,

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,100
so for LinkedIn, whatever, we'll do a whole press connect and a note and

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,130
then write,

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,700
and then I'll write about

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,220
what the

10
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,390
cost and the meal,

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:55,980
and then

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:01,950
I'll

13
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,460
change it. So I invite,

14
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,910
so I sent an invite to him and then I included

15
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,250
message click send,

16
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,930
and yeah, hopefully now he replies.

17
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,310
Then if he doesn't, we'll see how actually to reach out to him.

18
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,980
And here, what I wanted to show you is sometimes people may comment to

19
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:44,610
reach out to other people. And what I usually do is,

20
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,230
uh, give a bit of context and Ty mentioned people who

21
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,300
recommended, and that usually helps.
