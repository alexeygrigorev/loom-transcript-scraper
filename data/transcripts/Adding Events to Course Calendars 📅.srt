00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:04,723
Hi, so we have this event on next Monday.

2
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:08,806
What we also do for course events is to add them to the course

3
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:11,027
calendar. So we have a bunch of course calendars,

4
00:00:11,087 --> 00:00:14,089
I think I added you to all of them. So here we have Data

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,351
Engineering Zoom Camp, LLM Zoom Camp,

6
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:18,432
Machine Learning Zoom Camp, ML Ops Zoom Camp.

7
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:21,154
So these are calendars for the respective courses.

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:26,698
And what I want to do now is to add this thing to the

9
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:30,280
course calendar. So this is a reminder for course participants.

10
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:32,912
To those who are subscribed to the events,

11
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,594
so they want to also get notified. And by the way,

12
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:40,457
when we, when you create a process document, like all the context information I

13
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:43,199
give at the beginning, do not forget to put this in the process document.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,702
This is very important. Later, it will help us to actually understand why

15
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:51,344
a certain process document exists, what kind of thing it's used for.

16
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,226
Anyways, so I wanted to show you how to,

17
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:58,589
how we create events for course calendars.

18
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:03,812
So this one, I think it's, It's called MLZoomCamp Pre-Course

19
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:08,656
Q&A, right? Then the link,

20
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:11,197
the location link, as always,

21
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,880
is our YouTube.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,842
We don't have any guests. And then when it comes to the calendar,

23
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:20,844
you select Machine Learning Zoom Camp,

24
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:22,925
because this is for Machine Learning Zoom Camp.

25
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:26,287
If it's for another course,

26
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:29,329
then we select the course, right? So right now it's for Machine Learning Zoom

27
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,482
Camp, so we make.

28
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:36,093
We select this calendar. Okay, so I

29
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:40,196
think that's it. We can also add descriptions.

30
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:42,398
So in this case, we actually have a Luma event.

31
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,659
We can also add that.

32
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:53,585
Where is it? I don't remember actually what we usually

33
00:01:54,926 --> 00:02:00,070
write there, but the important thing is like at least we have a

34
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:03,792
rebuttal. Mind that for people who are subscribed to the calendar,

35
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:09,436
they see this. And also the actual start over

36
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:12,418
here. I've already created them.

37
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:16,681
I also amp course launch.

38
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:22,845
So I'll add it and

39
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:25,747
then of course I also need to add this.

40
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:30,774
Okay, so this is how we add course how

41
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:32,280
we add events to course calendars.
