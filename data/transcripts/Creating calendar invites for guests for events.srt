1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,410
If I showed it last time, but before I even create an event,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,010
what I do is I sent and calendar on the white to take

3
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,300
guest. So for that,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,540
um, I go to my calendar calendar and

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,960
we plan the event on the 8th of February.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,940
So here, and then I create an event data talks

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,360
club. So this event is a webinar,

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,270
right? I've been there now for podcasts,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,920
they considered mode. So for podcast event is data talks,

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,570
co-op club podcast. So then I

11
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,540
add and guest, I just make a copy,

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,390
a copy of the email.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,940
So when you create this, uh, add meat,

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,840
so, uh, my name would be in my email will be connect.

15
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:02,580
See what looks cool or something that was mainly in the future.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,260
And yeah,

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,720
here for now,

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,760
we can just, okay. Time is,

19
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,130
it starts at 17.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,360
And I usually send to an event for five minutes earlier,

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,490
so it will 1655 and then it ends at

22
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,110
18 series zero. So now I click save.

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,770
I do not sent yet because they want to add now

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,620
a zoom meeting. So I

25
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,330
know they went, so this is theirs. This

26
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,610
is the zoom Euro that we use for,

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,720
for connecting. So put it here.

28
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,360
And just in case I also put it in this collection.

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,230
So it's clickable and yeah,

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,430
by the way, the permission should be that guests can modify events event,

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,990
invite others and see guest lists. And this modifier events is mostly

32
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,630
needed for me. So when I do,

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,730
uh, when you and me, and then for example,

34
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:19,260
I need to change something. So then I can do this and

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,250
no, we edit the Euro.

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,790
So now I click save and then I note sent there,

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,360
and this is here that I haven't included a

38
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,760
link here yet.

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,410
So awesome. And as you see,

40
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,620
we have events on Tuesdays webinars,

41
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,300
podcasts on Friday, usually. And they are usually at 5:00 PM my time.

42
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,360
Okay. That's a thing called I wanted to show.
