1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,530
My creative thrill board. So what I did is I created this for

2
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:11,330
templates and to use the pro this whole time document that you created.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,970
So what I did is the week thing here.

4
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:20,510
I created the checklist. First of all,

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,230
I put to the description, did they link to this document?

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,140
Because it doesn't seem to be possible to add links to the checklist and

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,160
yeah, maybe let me show you. So for podcasts,

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,640
what you can do is you can take this document.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,040
Then I clicked here and then to put

10
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,660
this to the description,

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,610
and then now could eat checklist,

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,430
which quick on call just to please, and

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,740
then think this is not needed.

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,580
Yeah, indeed. This is, um,

15
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,710
We'll just copy this thing here,

16
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,910
then paste and then click.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,970
And now it's been,

18
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,660
So now we'll have all the things from there and then now

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,080
you move this well, can you see all this link here or

20
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:01,730
not do it right now? And then there are a couple of things

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,140
that this is in mind for this one.

22
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,780
Um, so we can try to do,

23
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,110
do, did what it seems to like it's on the weight.

24
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,910
So what I do is I add a task

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,340
that says reminder or item,

26
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,450
um, next,

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,800
And then I put them in front of them in front of these to

28
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,670
remind the guests.

29
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,850
We don't need to add any other reminders.

30
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,620
Yeah. So you do this for the rest of the other tool and by

31
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:07,200
the way, you do not need to create process document for that.

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,900
This is more like one think.

33
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,440
Hmm. Okay.

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,540
Yeah, we'll have that. And let's say we want to now

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,000
create, uh, we'll need to create these templates for all the

36
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:26,640
things we'll have in our pipeline. So for example,

37
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,320
um, this, well,

38
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:35,790
we'll have a walk with, uh, with Roy that

39
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,640
happens next week. So for that,

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,350
what we can do is click on the template,

41
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,170
then create click created, cut from template.

42
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,180
Now for the book of the week, we can do,

43
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,090
um, let's think perhaps just

44
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,320
Monday will be enough.

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,120
My, so create your cards and then yeah,

46
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,460
it shouldn't be, I need to hear

47
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,320
it is announced. So put it here. And next time I create something

48
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,840
from template. Actually, I should have done this,

49
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,680
a good clear plate. So the least you,

50
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,350
instead of keeping template, you select something else now

51
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,990
with withdrawing, what do we need is,

52
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,120
you know what, each top I'm gonna eat on the lead.

53
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,270
We did all that.

54
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,560
Um, so I, I asked him,

55
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,000
you've always email

56
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,130
On links in the description. I actually don't know

57
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,370
What this thing is.

58
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,700
And should we share?

59
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,890
So we did that and then yeah.

60
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,770
Reminders. So when we are already here,

61
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:43,530
so you mentioned that this book is not coming in next week.

62
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,400
So what we do is,

63
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:50,400
um, this reminder for the next week,

64
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,650
you just to dates and then this

65
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:57,860
call would do, yeah,

66
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,800
I think you can set it to date that

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,480
yeah, no Wednesday before they went. So if they went on 28

68
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,040
February, you would put him reminder here,

69
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,390
doesn't matter. The time doesn't really matter, then I save it.

70
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,330
And then yeah. We'll, we'll cover remind

71
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,360
you to actually do this, reach out to the author.

72
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,780
Hm. Yeah.

73
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,700
So, and they did try to remind her just today.

74
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,500
I asked them and yeah,

75
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:47,680
so this thing is the announcement.

76
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,350
Then I invited the author to smoke.

77
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,990
Yeah. So before this shouldn't let me change this a

78
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,220
bit. So,

79
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,430
uh, once

80
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,960
then this is,

81
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,910
uh, yeah, so ,

82
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,370
and after that we invite them to slack,

83
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,600
which would happen on Wednesday. Okay.

84
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,750
Here. Now we can rearrange these things,

85
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,270
uh, as we see better.

86
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,030
And in general, this is the approach and wonderful,

87
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,280
I guess over time, we'll figure out how to best organized.
