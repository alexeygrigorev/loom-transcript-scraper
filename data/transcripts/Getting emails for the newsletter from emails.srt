1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,320
Um, hi. Yeah know, just wanted to show you how to actually do this.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,490
So when you go to an event to dashboard,

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,430
there is this thing responses to custom questions.

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:16,110
So click on this. It will open another page

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,450
and in this page. Yeah. So we select the event we want.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,700
Right. And then, uh,

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,560
so yeah, this is statement, uh, this is the data we have and we,

8
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,740
as you see, we actually have this thing here.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,190
Right? So this is fair. They think we want,

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,380
right. So now I just download it as CSV,

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,770
open it, like usually, and oh,

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,590
we have this data here a while.

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,600
So like a lot of new stuff,

14
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:55,040
I guess they kind of separated it. So now we need to go to

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,310
custom questions and yeah,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,900
you have it all here. So do this call.
