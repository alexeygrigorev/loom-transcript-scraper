00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,810
Hi, I wanted to show you how to create slack dumps.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,490
So slack dump is, um,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,690
like a backup sort of like,

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,210
uh, all the information. All the conversations from slack is,

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,850
uh, are exported in a file.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,610
So I wanted to show you how to get this data and,

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,130
um, for this, um, so we click on this icon here or not icon

8
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:30,760
with the, the thing and then tools.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,190
And I think we go to actually workplace settings.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,980
Yeah, that's right. So, uh,

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,660
workplace setting, setting, seminar administration,

12
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:47,220
workplace settings, and then here we click on import expert data.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,020
So then it's expert here and then here

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,540
expert data, entire history,

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,170
and then start, this usually takes some time.

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,720
So I will, um, put this on,

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,600
on pause and once it finishes,

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,400
it can take some time. So it actually says that,

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,480
uh, yeah, so that it will be an email.

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,200
So right now I will just put it on pause and then come back.

21
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,180
It finishes. Okay.

22
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,900
So I got this email from slack. Uh,

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,660
also usually they send,

24
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,060
um, bot notifi.

25
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,900
So either way we can just go links,

26
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,620
lead to the same thing, this page,

27
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:49,070
where we initiated here,

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,380
we just downloaded.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,230
So I dunno how much time it took, uh,

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,870
five, 10 minutes maybe to do this.

31
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:02,740
Uh

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,870
doesn't to do when it opens.

33
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,750
Um, let me just go to thes. Yeah,

34
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,030
this is this thing. So now I want to go,

35
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:27,950
I just created a special channel. I also added a you here.

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,180
So in this channel, I want to upload this down so

37
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:37,460
other people can also use it. Uh,

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,870
so go first down with all the data

39
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,050
and yeah, so now I just put the down

40
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:59,570
here so people can use it. So this is how you expert

41
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,530
the slack data [Inaudible] and this is how you're shared with the rest of

42
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:04,930
the community.
