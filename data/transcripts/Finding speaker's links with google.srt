1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,720
Another thing I wanted to talk about. So I noticed that you asked me,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:03,960
sir,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,770
So, you know, hear me, sir. So you said present us view and link.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,310
So we get caught up LinkedIn, Twitter and others. So I want to make

5
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:18,620
it a little bit easier for the guests.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,840
So I already, it's actually pretty easy to Google fittings,

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,510
so I just speak her name And

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,310
Type it in and then only see the LinkedIn account,

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,510
but it doesn't work for everyone, of course. And,

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,320
uh, yeah, you know,

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,800
it's quite easy that for example, you needed

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,780
it. So then I just put this card and then we find,

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,950
Um, so what are we going to do is,

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,850
uh, or Let me open the template.

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,140
So here are the links. So when we clone the template,

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,150
we can try to look up speakers.

17
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,730
So just do the same thing and,

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,790
uh, Yeah.

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,230
And to find the links to LinkedIn.

20
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,100
Um, so with the website, it could be a little bit more difficult,

21
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,430
but sometimes it's for example. So for me, It's very easy because

22
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,880
it shows like this personal page, not everyone has this.

23
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,250
Sometimes you need to ask separately,

24
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,560
but yeah, so typically you just Google the name of the person and then

25
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,790
you can already find the thing.

26
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,750
So, um, think you can add this to the

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,560
practice document when you create this podcast page.

28
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,100
The one I just asked you, So this one,

29
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:17,820
<v 1>Um,

30
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,890
Yeah, so this one, um,

31
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,880
so you can add it to the same process document,

32
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:41,130
or I don't know, maybe create another document that describes how

33
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:45,660
to find to profiles And then a few of

34
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:50,370
them in. And then the next thing you need to do is modify your

35
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:55,020
temp or the template we sent This template.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,710
And, um, instead of please send us your view and links.

37
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,860
So we still need to be home. It's not always easy to find,

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,300
um, and picture your picture.

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,520
Um, we don't,

40
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,120
we can just ask, and then we can say,

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,830
we found some of your profiles. So your profile,

42
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,380
LinkedIn Teeter, we can mention them say,

43
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:27,130
we've found some of your profiles, please check the page to verify that they

44
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:31,120
are correct. And for example,

45
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,970
if we didn't find a little place, you can say, if you have a

46
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:36,490
personal, what patient do you want us to add it?

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,340
Please let us know what it is. Yeah.

48
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,620
So this is how you will look up people's profiles

49
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,920
on the internet. And sometimes,

50
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,110
actually when I sent you, um,

51
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,530
contact information of people to contact them,

52
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,520
we already have their LinkedIn. So since we already have their LinkedIn,

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,400
there's no reason to ask cold LinkedIn because we already have it.

54
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,970
Let me just go. I actually got in touch, I think with Mr.

55
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,500
So yeah, please modify the template and let's do some preparation work and

56
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:18,730
few in these as much as we can before asking speakers to do that.

57
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,720
And I think he'll.
