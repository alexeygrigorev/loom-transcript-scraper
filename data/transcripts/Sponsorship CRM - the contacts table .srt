1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,270
Hi. So yeah, talking, um,

2
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:05,230
about Taylor. So I asked,

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,990
um, not to do it yourself. I wanted to show you,

4
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:10,550
show you how to do this. So go to LinkedIn.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,190
I have his profile. He actually accepted my invitation sometime ago.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,070
So just find him, Taylor.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,230
All good. So I'll get his profile

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,110
and then I will go to our,

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,870
um, air table.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,670
We have this sponsorship CRM there,

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,830
and I'll just open it, uh,

12
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:40,150
sponsorship, CRM contacts and

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,350
mm, you actually, you already edited this,

14
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,510
right? So he's,

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,550
uh, called, uh,

16
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:50,590
because I already contacted him, but it's,

17
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:54,110
it was a call email, so nobody introduced me to to him.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,750
Um, so it was just, uh, I found him,

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,710
I sent him a connection request. Actually let me open it here.

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,430
So I sent him a connection request, uh,

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,710
um, on September 18th.

22
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,430
I don't know why there is too.

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:13,910
<v 1>Can I,

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,070
This weird. Should be just one.

25
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,180
I will, I cannot remove it.

26
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,560
Okay, well what's going on?

27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,400
Okay, so we already have,

28
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,440
have him and the last time connected was yesterday.

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:41,040
So let's just go here and we

30
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:45,560
select the date from yesterday. Um,

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,760
then status of the company.

32
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,480
Yeah, we don't have any status here.

33
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,880
Um, we don't know this one,

34
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,120
this one. And uh,

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,800
so I will also go here and I will say,

36
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,080
so I usually just write, sent a connection request

37
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:12,640
and then here in the comments it shows where was it done,

38
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,840
where the connection request was done. So for example,

39
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:19,360
for this year, uh, we can see for Yearon the comment

40
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:23,480
was done 12 days ago on September 30.

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,120
Right. So we know when we sent the connection,

42
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,720
Um, yeah, but here I can edit it.

43
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,200
Can edit it, send the connection request on September,

44
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,680
uh, when was it?

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,960
<v 1>September 18th.

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,240
And yeah, so we was the last contact and we were just waiting

47
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:55,600
for him to check and he didn't seem to like usually,

48
00:02:55,601 --> 00:03:00,080
for example, um, let me check it.

49
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,840
No, we don't, I'm just trying to see how

50
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,000
we can see that they saw the message.

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,600
Cause now we can see that it was sent,

52
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,400
but I don't know if what it was actually a received.

53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,480
<v 1>I,

54
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,760
Yeah, probably it doesn't show this information,

55
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:25,360
but at least, uh, yeah, at least, at least it was

56
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,080
sent. Okay. I'm really worried about this duplicate.

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,200
Um, but yeah, I think it's fine.

58
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,680
So what else did I want to show you here?

59
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,160
Yeah, the sponsorships here. There was another woman I talked,

60
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,040
he, so is from Varu.

61
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,720
So let me add here to,

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:54,990
<v 1>Um,

63
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,060
LinkedIn. Then your name is this

64
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:03,300
one.

65
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,180
<v 1>Um,

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,210
Account executive. Usually.

67
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:14,650
Account executive is somebody from sales. So this is not a super relevant role,

68
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,490
but she invited me to some LinkedIn group and they thought since she initiated

69
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:23,650
the contact, I would, uh, pitch back and say,

70
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:27,090
Hey, like there is this nice community that you can sponsor.

71
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,090
So the company is for our room,

72
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,370
so somebody will already have them.

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,730
Good. And wondering why for like,

74
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,690
uh, what kind of contact

75
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,930
we had with them. Was there some,

76
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,490
I'm just wondering, uh, was there some content that we,

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,930
Okay, nevermind. So the company is already there.

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,530
Last content contact was,

79
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,730
let's say today. Um,

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,170
I don't have your email yet. And lead status,

81
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,650
let's say, um,

82
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,640
contacted, she's kind of still called,

83
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:20,320
but, uh, hm. I'm still trying to figure out

84
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,120
what's the best way to think about this.

85
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,400
Um, this lead status. Um,

86
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:31,840
so let me just show you what we have here. So prospect is when

87
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,160
we, um,

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,710
Uh, prospect is when we just add them to,

89
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,190
um, this spreadsheet to,

90
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,790
to this table. And then maybe we all sent a connection request

91
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,310
in, uh, in,

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,830
in LinkedIn, but nothing else. So they're potentially interesting.

93
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,390
Cold is when we contact them, but it was,

94
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,440
it was a called outreach.

95
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,560
So we don't know them. Nobody introduced us to them.

96
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,760
And uh, yeah, so we just found them on LinkedIn and wrote them a

97
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:08,800
message. Then contacted,

98
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,800
I think, yeah, it's kind of not needed because it's the same as called

99
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,720
Hot is, uh, when somebody introduced us to them.

100
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,120
Or for example, um, if I go on a conference and

101
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:23,320
meet somebody. So then we already have,

102
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,480
uh, established contact. So then it would be a follow up from the conference.

103
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,080
It would be already hot lit, uh,

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,480
proposed is, uh, when we talked and when we had,

105
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,840
um, on discussion.

106
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:42,480
And then I sent them an offer saying that,

107
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:45,720
uh, this is what we can do and this is how much it costs,

108
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,800
then it's proposed and then deal if we they agree and

109
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,280
then introduce colleagues. So oftentimes, uh,

110
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:55,400
we talk not to the right people.

111
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,480
So for example, this, he, he,

112
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,040
yeah, he probably is,

113
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,920
uh, not the right person because she's,

114
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,640
um, account executive. She's not in marketing.

115
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,120
She's not in partnership, right.

116
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:14,640
So probably, um, she does not own the budget for marketing,

117
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,560
but if, um, she can introduce us to her colleagues,

118
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,720
uh, who are in marketing, who are in partnership management,

119
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,760
then, um, yeah,

120
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:29,040
then I, It's good.

121
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,520
And we can just change, introduce colleague and then we can,

122
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,440
uh, link who is the colleague or just add the colleague here and then

123
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,160
write and comments that it was introduced by he.

124
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,320
So this is what happened, uh, here,

125
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,960
uh, with, um, let me see.

126
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:51,280
It was a company, um,

127
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,410
Snow Plow. Yeah. So then I met Jordan at

128
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,730
the conference and then she introduced me to Eddie.

129
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,490
And then, uh, we already started talking,

130
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,330
um, with Eddie, but yeah,

131
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,010
I actually need to follow up with him.

132
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,290
Yeah, that's, uh, the table contacts in the sponsorship

133
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,890
serum and when we find people in,

134
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,210
uh, LinkedIn that we want to contact.

135
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,370
So we just add them as prospect.

136
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,010
We sent them a connection request and then,

137
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,930
uh, yeah, we add a note when the connection request was sent.

138
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,250
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,290
Okay. That's all for this one for.
