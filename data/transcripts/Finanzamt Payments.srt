1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,340
We have a few payments to Finansamt.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,920
Finansamt is a tax office in Germany.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,160
So, this is when I need to pay taxes. I need to transfer a

4
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:16,400
lot of money to them. I transferred some money today and

5
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:20,920
some money last month. I wanted to show you how I

6
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,280
put them right now into this.

7
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:27,706
Scratch it. So, right now I created a new tab here called taxes.

8
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:31,106
And I put,

9
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:35,806
like, all this all these payments there just to keep track in

10
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:38,526
one place, causing, you know, it might get lost or whatever.

11
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:42,826
And the way I do this, so, if I click here,

12
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:45,106
it says what kind of tax.

13
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:51,344
I paid it's giverbistor. There are two types of taxes.

14
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:58,584
This, the first one giverbistor. And the second one is this,

15
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:03,204
I'm commenstor. So, I took these things and I put them there.

16
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:05,764
So, this is here, giverbistor here,

17
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:08,704
commenstor here. So, this is the money I paid last.

18
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:13,594
For 2022. And this is the money I paid today.

19
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:17,134
So, right now I need to pay like, quarterly.

20
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:20,934
For some reason in this year, it's every,

21
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:23,774
it's not every quarter, but only second,

22
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:27,014
third and fourth quarter. Anyways,

23
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:30,014
so next time you see a payment to finance out.

24
00:01:32,404 --> 00:02:09,645
Here in the you can just put it there.

25
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:40,164
, in this in

26
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:42,464
this thing. Yeah. It was like, for example,

27
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:47,404
if our accountants ask if we paid something or we did not pay

28
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:50,884
how much and so on, you can refer to this table,

29
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,604
to this spreadsheet and tell them, okay.

30
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:59,417
That's all. So maybe you can create a small process document that

31
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:04,117
describes that, but for now you at least know what this

32
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:08,077
what these records are and where we should put them in the spreadsheet.

33
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:09,097
Yeah. That's it.
