1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,550
Okay. So where do they work? So we will need to send some things

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,610
to the attendees. So I wanted to show you how to send emails to

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,150
people, to sign up for a workflow. So what are the workflow?

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,840
And then we are getting,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,910
let's see, they keep changing it's and

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,360
yeah, it's managed to attendees emails,

7
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,190
um, event in

8
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:40,700
UML,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,580
um, the work

10
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,090
or buy a lots

11
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,680
of columns there.

12
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,560
This will be different for when we need to send

13
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:34,150
something. Let me just make it a bit

14
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:34,540
larger.

15
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,220
The workshops I'm going to be your

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,970
female stuff.

17
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,800
I don't think it's actually needed. So I

18
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,260
will send a chest event to myself to see.

19
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,770
So for the workshop, I guess that is enough.

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,270
So I will just send it right now.

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,700
Sometimes we might send it like one day before it starts or something like

22
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:34,400
this, but, um, yeah,

23
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,680
so I will just send it. So

24
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:43,790
now this email,

25
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,650
and let's make a copy of the text because I also now want

26
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:55,090
to show you about the same thing in,

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:00,810
<v 1>But,

28
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,270
Um, they send it to myself,

29
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,970
so copy it and

30
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,360
then this, and yeah,

31
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,450
so members who RSVP and,

32
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,870
and I will call it message.

33
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,220
<v 1>I'm done.

34
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,350
Yeah, I dunno.

35
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:37,870
<v 1>Yeah.

36
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,240
So this is how you sent messages, emails to our

37
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:51,600
events.
