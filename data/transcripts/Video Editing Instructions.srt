1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
So the problem is with a bunch of videos that I recorded.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,660
In particular all first module except the very first video.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,440
So starting from 1.2 and the first module from

4
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:17,021
the second module. They all have

5
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:20,689
uhm they are quite uh silent,

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,396
very quiet, you can hear it.

7
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:28,412
And at the beginning there is this ding,

8
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:33,803
you hear it too, right? Usually in loom for some reasons you always have

9
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:36,594
that. So this is annoying.

10
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:39,739
And that's why we will use the tool that I built.

11
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,485
You, this is the file I sent you.

12
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:51,463
Start so that there are two components like the uhm the the

13
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:55,610
user interface and the terminal. First you select the file you want to edit.

14
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,775
So this is the uhm the file.

15
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:03,486
When you browse it automatically detects by how much you need to increase the

16
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:08,154
volume. And also this is not automatic but

17
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:11,973
this is at the beginning this ding sound you want to cut.

18
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:14,698
it. So this is from where we start.

19
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,763
So usually you don't need to change it if there is this ding.

20
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:20,548
If there is no ding then you put it to zero,

21
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,967
right? So first you do a test run.

22
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,475
Click process and then it's complete and then there

23
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,779
is a new file only for one minute.

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,626
Hey everyone, in this video I want to show you how to configure your

25
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:39,240
environment. You hear that it's much louder in this part you will give

26
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,529
call up you can just run things locally for the second module google and

27
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:48,186
access to a machine with gpu now let

28
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:53,115
me go back I remove the test run click process so

29
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:58,096
test run is just for testing now it actually redo redo

30
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:02,935
is redoing the whole video so when it's

31
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:07,523
over we will see like a

32
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:10,331
sign that it's over.

33
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,067
So it will take a bit of time.

34
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,792
So it's over and we have the new file.

35
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,723
Hi everyone, in this video I want to show REST manager.

36
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:37,074
Yeah, so this is louder and we

37
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:40,000
don't have this ding sound. And then,

38
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,378
just in case,

39
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,743
so you will need to do this for all the files.

40
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,908
And if you need to select the next one,

41
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:51,635
you again do the same thing. Let's say this is the next one.

42
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:55,713
Now it will analyze it. And yeah,

43
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:58,438
it thinks it needs to increase it a little bit.

44
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:01,242
But yeah, so this is how you do it.

45
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:05,570
You of course don't do this This is just an example that this is

46
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:11,440
how you proceed with the next one. And quickly show you how you download

47
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,944
videos from YouTube.

48
00:03:14,204 --> 00:03:16,628
You probably know that. But just in case,

49
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,245
you go to YouTube, to YouTube and go to a video

50
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:28,757
that we're interested in and we will need to do this

51
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,682
one, this one, this one, so we don't need to do it.

52
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:36,233
1.1 but the rest from LLMZoomCamp except

53
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:41,353
the new ones that I sent today we need to do this and

54
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,884
let's say for this one this is how we download the

55
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:50,373
videos. If we don't have a process document for downloading videos from YouTube I

56
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:54,968
think we do but if we don't please create it and

57
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:59,967
also please create a process document for using this tool but

58
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,992
only after you complete and re-upload all the videos.

59
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:07,074
So this is how you do it for this video.

60
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:10,955
So again, first test run, you check that things work.

61
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:18,908
Welcome back, this is Mo, And,

62
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,823
This is how you do it. So now, let me show you how to

63
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:27,153
close it. Oops.

64
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:29,277
Okay, so please create a doc,

65
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:34,217
process document. Two process documents,

66
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:36,741
one for the tool, one for downloading videos,

67
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,646
if we don't have them, this yet,

68
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:43,601
and then also do it for all the videos I showed,

69
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:48,368
and so we need to download the video,

70
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,912
apply the tool, and pre-upload the video,

71
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:55,231
and also first remove the video from the playlist,

72
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:57,865
this is important, first remove the video from the playlist,

73
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:01,471
then upload the new one, and if everything is fine,

74
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,717
after you re-upload all that, you don't delete them first,

75
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:08,992
you let me know, I check, and then you delete the old videos.

76
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,860
So this is what we do, and please do it as soon as possible,

77
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:17,065
we want to finish it before Monday, because on Monday this course starts,

78
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:20,770
and we need the first module be ready.

79
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:24,305
Okay, thank you very much. So first you do this,

80
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:28,813
then you give me a check-in, then you create process documents,

81
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:33,690
you send me the process documents, and then that's roughly the plan.

82
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:34,498
Yep, thanks.
