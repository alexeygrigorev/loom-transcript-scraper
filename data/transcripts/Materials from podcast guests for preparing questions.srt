1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,330
Okay. So now we have a lot of emails like this,

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:07,320
like Chrome, for example. So now that she sends links,

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,270
but then these links are all in the email.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,200
So it's hard to make my life will be easier to prefer.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,620
We should wait. We should add

6
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:27,540
like a special section in our podcast documents where we

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,830
let's say the lines here and then ,

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,050
and then we edit here. Oops.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:41,880
So

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,080
Now clean formatting. Yeah. Like that.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,090
So let's do like that every

12
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,340
time when guests send some materials.

13
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,270
So we'll have questions here and then at the end we'll get some materials.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,980
So this way I will always know where to find the materials.

15
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:08,180
So instead of going through these email chains,

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,400
they will always be in the document.

17
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:13,100
And then there will be a link to that.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,780
So yeah, maybe do this and you can also update our template.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,210
So at the lines. Yeah. And then with yours,

20
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:22,670
from the guest, and this is what we .

21
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,710
So for the

22
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,820
questions, don't think about this.

23
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,380
Yeah. Maybe. Yeah.

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,910
Let's, let's do it like this. And then once we prepare questions,

25
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:49,280
I guess this can go away.

26
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,660
But anyways, so please do like for all the forecast

27
00:01:56,661 --> 00:02:00,680
we have, like, when a guest send somebody also please,

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,000
uh, put it here. And I think, uh, by the way,

29
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:08,480
we need to announce this to right now,

30
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,940
take a look at them, but yeah, please,

31
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:15,560
please do this. And yeah,

32
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:20,390
we modify the template and I guess it could also be

33
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,550
one of the checkpoints in our template.

34
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:29,150
Right. So get links from this,

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,710
the guest, if they provide any and then put them to the document.

36
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,160
Okay.
