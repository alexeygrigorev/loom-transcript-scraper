1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,700
Instead of grading line breaks.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,190
They, I find them give you the line. Sorry.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,140
So if you really want to make sure that it's kind of like,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,960
you might just stay together is an option that you,

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,190
and, um, so you can use the page let's set up.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,570
So you go to file where you sit up and then you use page

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,530
plus, and then you see like,

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,430
uh, it's just one page. Everything is one page.

9
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:30,150
So then you don't really need to have this line rates because like the

10
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:33,420
images are always most to,

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,900
you know, so yeah.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,580
Please don't add line breaks.
