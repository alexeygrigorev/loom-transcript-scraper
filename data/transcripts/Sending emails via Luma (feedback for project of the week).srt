00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,280
So we use Luma remember for Project of the week.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,200
So I wanted to show you how to send this message.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,720
Uh, so we want to ask people who registered and participated.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,040
We want to ask them for feedback. So I want to show you how

6
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:25,180

7
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:28,600
