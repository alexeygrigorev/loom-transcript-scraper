1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,250
Okay. Now I want to show you,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,760
um, how I create documents for podcasts.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,010
So Rahul reached out to me.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,220
He wants to be a guest on a podcast. Well,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,020
here, it doesn't matter who reached out to, but we agreed that he

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,720
will be a guest on the podcast doesn't

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:26,910
work. Yeah. So we talked about different topics that he talk

8
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:29,160
about and we chose this,

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,050
uh, transitioning from data engineer to data engineering manager.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,660
Yeah. And then went on a date and

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,400
what they want to show you. So this is specific for podcast needed for

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,890
other types of plants. So for that,

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,380
we need to, I am going to actually,

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,110
I should share with video.

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,670
Sure. Let me share this whole folder with you.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,330
Yeah. In editor, sorry.

17
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,300
In this four halter, what he needs is,

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,860
uh, what cost in this

19
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:23,010
podcast. Yeah. I have a lot of copies of copies,

20
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,770
but this is all you name it.

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,290
We don't need to put this in documented.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,920
This is just a template that I use all this piles at the same.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,960
So all these names, uh, they follow the same format,

24
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,150
August documents. So you see, this is a document that I prepared for the

25
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:49,890
podcast tomorrow. So this is that

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,260
the name is the date when it happens,

27
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,390
the name of the person and then the topic. So let

28
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,480
me take, uh, take this copy of compete,

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,010
open it. And I add in name,

30
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,110
item of this template. And then the date

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,480
is, were agreed on February 18th.

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,340
So it will be February.

33
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,100
Then the name will be a full chain.

34
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,220
Yeah. Please do with capital case and

35
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:42,220
then topic, uh, still to be discussed.

36
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,250
Um, inquiry time, we agreed on transitioning

37
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,350
from data engineer, data, new manager.

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,620
Um, and then, so because I already have his email

39
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,130
and, um, shared with him,

40
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,890
sorry, say it there. Or usually what I do is I just click share

41
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,980
and then, um, probably link.

42
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,870
So change to 31 with a link, then make an editor,

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,230
write them down.

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,630
And then I write know I

45
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:32,760
asked that question or are,

46
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,870
oh, and if you just start with

47
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,720
questions, there can,

48
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:50,910
now I will not send it yet because I now want to add

49
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,900
two special guests today.

50
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,380
See here. Welcome.

51
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,070
Um, and I think that topic will be from

52
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,890
date, uh, each year to date,

53
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,550
uh, gee, this is you.

54
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,620
Could we discussed, uh,

55
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,430
what I think this is what we agreed on and we will need to

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,450
agree on the outline. And,

57
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,030
um, here we will hear

58
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,510
these questions.

59
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,040
So also think of some questions and I will put them here,

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,190
but also we wanted to put the questions he wants to get

61
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:51,650
me to ask him then.

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,170
So this is what I sent,

63
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,900
uh, sign on

64
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,330
my side as well. And

65
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,090
yeah, so now we have this,

66
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,790
then we also, I also need, even before that,

67
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,730
I think I didn't do, I should go down this.

68
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,730
So, uh, I need to add him to the spreadsheet sort

69
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:28,160
of chain. And then topic is,

70
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,200
uh, uh,

71
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,870
from that engineer to that HD manager management and we

72
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,000
forwarded a few, the date system

73
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:41,750
is terrible.

74
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,470
Um, so that we have a document that

75
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,750
I sent that already has,

76
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,030
by the way, this is called the document or the final document looks like,

77
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,720
so what kind of title here? We accept title.

78
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,780
We have outlined here and we have

79
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,840
like some view, some interim, and then this,

80
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,510
uh, everyone, all the speakers get this question,

81
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,330
like before we go into the main topic of something that starts with your

82
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:23,030
background, and then these are custom questions that I add

83
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,610
to set, and then this way speakers,

84
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,600
uh, just know what exactly I am going to ask them on the podcast.

85
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,300
Yeah. And, uh, this document should attend a book,

86
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:41,840
something like that. Um,

87
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,430
and this is for me to do for me and for the guest,

88
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,530
not for you, but you will,

89
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:53,300
we'll ask you to help me usually create this document with this document.

90
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:57,410
What we need to do next is we need to create an event.

91
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,500
Uh, we need to send the calendar invite,

92
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,530
sorry. So we'll go to calendar.

93
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,030
And then this is something next week. So this happens.

94
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:16,880
So the title will be that at docs. What cost then?

95
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:20,360
Uh, so description is here.

96
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,570
Questions, questions here.

97
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,270
Hmm. Then I will add you as

98
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:37,800
well. So you can modify the event in case you need it

99
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,970
in case let's say a speaker just has to,

100
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:45,510
to cancel it or to move it. Then,

101
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:48,990
uh, it always starts five minutes before the actual start.

102
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,790
So this way now to make sure that we don't have

103
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:58,770
any technical problems, then I actually need to add the

104
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,380
guest excuse, email

105
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,880
email is here. And then yeah.

106
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:14,520
Then we need to add this link ups or

107
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,650
so I will to get the link.

108
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,610
I'll save it, but do not send the event.

109
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,010
Then I go, oops, this one.

110
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,730
But yeah, you will have this link. I think I already covered

111
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:41,000
it in notion, but all the events,

112
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,810
the webinars and all the podcasts, they have the same zoom link.

113
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,980
And then I, yeah.

114
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,860
Then I add there's one link here in the location.

115
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,740
And I also have, I

116
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:58,080
<v 1>Also have a document. I also edit to the document.

117
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,550
So the ink is always the same.

118
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,300
I will also send you this link, uh, and knowing what's up.

119
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,160
Yeah. And the important thing here is that just the emissions is that they

120
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:18,930
can modify events when you will create these events at me as

121
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,200
a, as a guest. So then I can modify it,

122
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,090
define it. Yeah.

123
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:30,210
I think that's all we need. So now I click save and then now

124
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,900
I click centers and now the guest will receive an education.

125
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,410
Yeah. So this is all of that.

126
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,390
<v 1>And I think that's all I wanted to show you. Let me check.

127
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,510
Yeah. Wow. Maybe I'll just,

128
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,000
uh, all right.

129
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:01,330
And I think

130
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,960
you will probably do this through email, but maybe it's really not as well.

131
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,710
I dunno. Or slack would be usually I use for that.

132
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,480
Um, LinkedIn, I use for that email I use for that slack

133
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,440
sometimes Twitter.

134
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,520
Okay. So that's how I do this.

135
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,150
So this is how I create the document.

136
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,430
And by the way, the first part of this video was specific to podcasts.

137
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,350
So the part with, um, creating a document and then sharing that with

138
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,520
the speaker, with a guest, but the second part of creating the calendar invite

139
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,460
this one, it is not specific to a podcast or

140
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,280
an African business. It is the same process.

141
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,350
Okay. That's all from me, please.
