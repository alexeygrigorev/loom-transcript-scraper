00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:04,850
I figured this would be interesting to see too,

2
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:09,391
how to extract images from um um luma in

3
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:13,955
a general uh uh preview from any website so let's see

4
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:17,085
let's say we want to extract a preview Uh,

5
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:21,050
the one we see here uh from this page right.

6
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:23,423
I use Google promising Google from.

7
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:26,487
You go here, click inspect.

8
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:30,563
And you see the code for um the website.

9
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:35,249
You go to head. And in head

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,166
you look for uh tech called

11
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,980
meta name. Can I make it larger?

12
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:47,657
No, I cannot. So it's meta name equals image

13
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:50,879
property. See. Oh go. Oh g image.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,881
So it's usually one of those.

15
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:56,075
Right. And the content.

16
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:59,170
Yeah double click on this. And this is the link.

17
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,846
That you can use.

18
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:14,584
can also see that this is specific to luma.

19
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:19,233
Um for our other websites it won't work.

20
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:23,378
We can also change the width and height here.

21
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:25,898
So for example if we want to have a larger image,

22
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:29,638
we can say can make it two times larger,

23
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:34,658
1,600. And here it would be 800.

24
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:38,226
Let's see if we can see.

25
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:40,583
this would give us a larger image.

26
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:43,081
There we can see this, right?

27
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:45,519
But this is specifically to Luma,

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,717
right? So other websites will not have that.

29
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:52,065
Other websites will just give us some that we can use for.

30
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:56,707
So yeah please create a process document for that.

31
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:01,500
Sometimes we might need just to extract the preview to

32
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,106
use it somewhere.
