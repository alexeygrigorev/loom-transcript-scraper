1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,990
Um, so, and I just thought you created these templates,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,390
a copy of the template, but here,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,700
this thing, you should replace it with the name,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,930
Mike planning to do this. And,

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,220
um, I also asked you to place,

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,300
this Should be the name.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,870
Um, I'll probably update the template a little bit,

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,270
but please this, the process,

9
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:32,310
doc, that all these things,

10
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:35,880
when you create, you should replace all this place folders.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,530
So an example would be X, you cannot replace because this is the topic,

12
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:43,260
which we didn't agree, but the already know the name.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,050
So please replace the names and I will change slightly

14
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:51,900
change them. And the place called those.

15
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,430
So it's clear for you what you need to change.
