1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,320
No, I want it to talk a bit about event.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,730
So here, actually, I dunno for some

3
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:14,550
reasons and brought me in LinkedIn,

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,340
but the, the flow is usually, um,

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,120
before announcing the winners, like at 10 on Friday,

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,460
I contact the author and they ask the one or the author or

7
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:30,090
the authors, if they want to select the winners themselves,

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,270
or I should pick them randomly in this case,

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,160
actually, if I go to your secure,

10
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:43,680
drop me in LinkedIn, not in slack in a way I usually slack.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,840
So yeah, she said, is it chosen by randomly?

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,580
Or they selected, so actually selected

13
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:58,170
the winners himself. So we should ask the authors if they

14
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:01,320
want to do this. And if they see that random is fine,

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,020
and then you coachable that procedure that you did for

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,360
this, in this case as well. Right? So you select,

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,380
um, yeah, but we need to ask the authors and

18
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:20,160
then I make this announcement for the winners.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,610
Um, and then after that, I say that,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,060
please send me your emails in text messages,

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,700
and I will pass them to here to me.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,930
Uh, but let's say this book course with pact,

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,330
I will dry, uh, or with some other publisher that would write something

24
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,190
like, uh,

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,010
let me just scroll past them and

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,460
they will show the book.

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,900
Uh, I'm not sure if I mentioned that in the previous video,

28
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,220
I just wanted to make sure you will know it. And then now they

29
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,230
start sending me their emails.

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,380
So for that tank or fuel our schedules in

31
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:16,920
this spreadsheet, we have these,

32
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,260
uh, yeah,

33
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,150
look up the week emails and here for this week,

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,290
I need to add. And he says,

35
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,370
uh,  learning.

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,490
Yeah. And I need to take the names of the winners without the ad.

37
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,600
Um, so that was,

38
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:50,630
yeah. Oops. So

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,060
now they start sending me the emails.

40
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,540
So for example, uh,

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,570
Allie sent me the email,

42
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,130
sent the mail, so then angle here and then check out Kim,

43
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,860
this is Holly here.

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,760
I can flip your case. And then I acknowledge same

45
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,650
thing. Then Dustin

46
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,870
also wrote me, Dustin's

47
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,590
email here as well. I also

48
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,400
wrote his email

49
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,530
And, and do I have any other emails?

50
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,970
So from doing,

51
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,720
And then we also need email from,

52
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,680
I don't know how to pronounce this actually,

53
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,680
but what I also do because you see,

54
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:23,070
I have emails of other people. So what I can do is control the

55
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:28,230
controller and check if this person already one before

56
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,230
and the fee already provided their email.

57
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,100
So in this case they didn't, for example,

58
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,710
if this was, um, DDM,

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,910
then I would sometimes write to William saying,

60
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:45,690
Hey, I got your email. If it hasn't changed that we'll just use the

61
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:50,340
same one. Yeah. So this email is still pending.

62
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,580
And after I have all five emails,

63
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,560
I will pop it down and send them to the author,

64
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,400
the publisher. So maybe I will record the secrets

65
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,600
email for that. Okay. So this is how we collect emails.

66
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:09,030
So we notice for the book of the week about.
