1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,570
<v 1>And just wanted to show you how to feel in sponsored book sponsored

2
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:14,340
book. So here with the visual.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,860
So I just downloaded it, the visual.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,090
So no, I click Show it from the beginning.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,780
So I click here on the image upload image.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,780
Excellent. And then I go to downloads and I

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:35,520
said, look, this is the image that they sent. So you just click open

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,390
And next. So bill sent me the link.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:55,820
Yeah.

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,830
<v 1>Oh yeah. The link goes here as well to the

11
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:04,850
button. So it goes both to then image into the backend

12
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,260
Here. This will be the title,

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,880
The title.

14
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,830
So you just paste it And

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,260
some texts. Yeah.

16
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:32,180
So this is the text. I will change the text

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,430
Later, but for now,

18
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,830
for example, I ask you to help. You can just, and

19
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:45,380
then like for something.

20
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,520
So for example, if there is no visual, you can just leave visual field.

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,050
If there is no title, you don't know what the title should be just

22
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:57,800
field. And if you don't know what the text should be,

23
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,160
you just feel text on attention. And then I can think,

24
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,200
So this is how you feel this in the sponsored

25
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:12,740
blog, That's all.
