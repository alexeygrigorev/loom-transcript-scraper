1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,090
So this is the author that I invited to slug.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,480
So he accepted the invite. So this is him.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,490
So now I need to invite him to book of the week channel.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,670
She's not here yet. And alum here,

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,060
people, um,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,610
and just name, click.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,010
I also noticed that it's possible to add email,

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,570
which is probably an answer because I already has his

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,470
email in case there are two,

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,630
uh,

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,460
to me, this person is already

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,110
there. So this is how you invite people to

13
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:57,880
chance. And with this message can

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,420
probably, you are not that many. They will meet you in admin.

15
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,210
You will be able to do this messages.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,730
So clearly some business call you invite people to Charles'.
