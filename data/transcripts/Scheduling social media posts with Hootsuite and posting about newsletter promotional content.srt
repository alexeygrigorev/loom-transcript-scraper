Hi, I wanted to show you how to schedule social media posts.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,440
I think you have access to them through us.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,800
So here in, you'd go to this calendar icon And

4
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:19,950
you have a calendar you can select it is,

5
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:23,370
this is my time zone in GMT plus two.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,420
Um, so for example,

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,100
eight, 8:00 AM. Usually I announce LinkedIn posts.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,340
Yeah. Posts, and then I can select an account.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,610
And here you select, for example,

10
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:43,740
this data talks club LinkedIn account,

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,580
And now we need to write a text and for the text we

12
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:57,950
had promotion in the,

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,930
in the newsletter. So I want to show you

14
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,120
also how to, uh,

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,040
announce how to post these promotions to social media as well.

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,950
So just copy the title,

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,510
Then copy the content.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,950
And then I copy the text here and

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,530
all right. Interlink

20
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,350
And also, I

21
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:54,880
think I'd say sufficient. Also we have visual

22
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,880
here, so we'll save it safely.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,760
<v 1>Oops.

24
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,110
So I see if the image, And then I hear

25
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,320
select file to upload. So then the usual is used

26
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:16,590
here

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,940
And I just clicks Cato. So this is how we schedule posts

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,670
to LinkedIn with quotes, and then we want to schedule another post

29
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:35,970
to Twitter. So I usually do this for Twitter.

30
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,880
I think 3:00 PM work, but for

31
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,190
LinkedIn usually in morning. Um,

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,360
so for Twitter afternoon works,

33
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:51,630
whether she's here. And we said that, wait,

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,560
there is no, I think only 2, 2 83

35
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,610
account. So the records,

36
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:06,670
they separate video, but yeah, this is how you get

37
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:11,320
at all posts on LinkedIn, how to promotions.

38
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,580
So please make a process document.

39
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,920
And next time when we have some promotionals in the newsletter,

40
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,860
then yeah, this is how we do this.
