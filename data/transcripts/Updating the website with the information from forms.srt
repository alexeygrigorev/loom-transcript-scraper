00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,300
Hi. So you just,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,450
it's this thing, a new event,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,490
visualizing mission to,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,250
um, have table for them. Say,

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,520
I wanted to show you how you can actually add this yourself to the

6
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:19,500
website. I created something that will

7
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:23,190
let you at this yourself. So go to the,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,210
get help page of the website. It looks plump,

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,230
uh, GitHub ,

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,470
I'll send you this link and then you go to

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,420
options and then in actions use to generate

12
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:46,190
all and hear engineering.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,010
You click around and then confirm,

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,080
and then it will take some time. So it will take a couple of

15
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:01,820
minutes. I can see that the previous thing around two minutes,

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,850
three minutes. So it takes a bit of time,

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,590
but yeah. Now after doing this,

18
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,960
um, yeah, you, you don't need to wait for me to have this

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,480
with, uh, uh, itself.

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,480
Um, maybe I will show you how to actually check that things

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,710
are edit correctly.

22
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,690
So will not call here. I would go to the previous round that just

23
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,160
want to show you how it looks like.

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,360
So here you need to click on this genital.

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,110
And then, uh, from all those things,

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,210
there are a bunch of jobs. Most of them prepare the environment.

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,700
This is a bit technical. So anyways,

28
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,740
you are interested in this thing,

29
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:03,090
this may call, and then you see that it

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,640
says processed zero people. So this is the form first processes

31
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,250
in this table. This form people,

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,980
that's the first group. That's all the people.

33
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,060
Then it processes books. Um,

34
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,180
so before previously, when I run with zero people edit zero and

35
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:30,420
zero, edit this podcast

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,560
either. It was actually a podcast and it's one,

37
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,140
this processed one podcast,

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,210
and then it processed zero events. So you actually

39
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:44,280
don't need to go here.

40
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,950
Everything should be fine. Um,

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,970
but just in case, um,  can

42
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,130
see what is running. So this is the thing I just executed right now.

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,850
Um, yeah, I just finished. And then if you go to make all right

44
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:08,530
now and say protest one

45
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,610
event, this the event,

46
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,860
it took this event from here from

47
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:22,180
this. And yeah.

48
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,790
Now if we can back to the main,

49
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,160
uh, there is a new commit.

50
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,760
So it's coming from GitHub actions and you

51
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,330
don't need to do this. All you need to do is just click a

52
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,980
button, but this is a bit more information to double check.

53
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,740
Maybe that things work. Um,

54
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,990
yeah, you see that this thing was added and now

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,810
in the website is being updated.

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,700
And once this thing just pages built and deployment,

57
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,140
then, then yeah,

58
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,580
it will have an updated version

59
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,970
this point.

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,750
Okay. Completed. So now if we,

61
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,720
if we, sorry.

62
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,670
Yeah, we'll have visualizing machine learning. So in summary,

63
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:46,230
what you need to do is automate your document and

64
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:48,870
process document. You go into actions,

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,700
you select generate, and you click workflow.

66
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,230
That's pretty much it. And then the rest is just a bit more

67
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:05,190
information. You don't need to document it right now.

68
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,290
If you want to see if things progressed,

69
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,510
you go to January and click

70
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:21,900
my call here to see what actually it protest some,

71
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:25,440
they just call you do this. And if this thing,

72
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,920
one of the steps is red becomes red,

73
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,710
then we'll not be able to produce an event.

74
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,310
Then you will need to let me know that something is important.

75
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,220
So I will probably receive an email. It's something that's broken.

76
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,690
And just in case, if let's say you run and then five minutes after

77
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:46,590
that, you come back and you see in actions that,

78
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,240
that it's all right. So something like this,

79
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,780
right? And then you just think, okay,

80
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,370
let's hold.
