00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:04,969
Hi, so the reason we did not see that in

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,714
our Phenom that they paid is because they are

3
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:13,852
the money is in the merchant account So this is like usually this is

4
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:17,707
what we see when I go to Revolut but then I go to merchant

5
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,330
and this is the money, right?

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:24,879
So we can see that this is the payment from them.

7
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,239
And we can see the processing team.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,957
So right so the invoice was for five.

9
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:36,581
Thousand, but we needed to pay this amount so we need to

10
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:41,152
also declare this as an expense And i'm

11
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:45,699
pretty sure this is not the first time I record this video But

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,423
um, so please check if we already have a process document And if we

13
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,903
do update it if we don't create a new one,

14
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:56,605
so the first process document would be for creating

15
00:00:56,606 --> 00:01:01,652
these bookkeeping documents Um for declaring the the piece.

16
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:06,330
All right, so we need to declare them And I think

17
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:11,366
this is how we do it. We just go and print And

18
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:15,342
in print we see we have this right so here we have this process

19
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:20,544
entity So right now you just save it Let me

20
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:25,151
Save it as pdf And then uhm yeah You save it and

21
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:29,760
you send it to that email Or Yeah

22
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:35,393
I think this is what we do Like we do with other invoices So

23
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:38,476
let me just put I'll put it on pause and then I'll do that

24
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:42,994
Okay, I saved this document It should appear

25
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:47,709
In our uhm

26
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:53,089
How do you call it? Bookkeeping uhm

27
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:58,465
No, it should appear a bit later.

28
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:03,076
I'll check it So then um the second process document I want

29
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:05,476
you to create And again, please check.

30
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:08,914
Uh, if we already have that, I think I think this is not the

31
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:13,590
first time I'm recording this video So you click withdraw Oh

32
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,031

33
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:22,670
I guess I'll do this later Uhm

34
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,781
Yeah, I don't know, what is that?

35
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:27,790
So I'll do this later and then yeah,

36
