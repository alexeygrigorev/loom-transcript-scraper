Hi. So I wanted to show you how to get invoices from LinkedIn.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,920
I don't know if we will actually keep LinkedIn sales navigator cause I

3
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:12,600
don't use it very often. Um,

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,520
yeah, but maybe we will. So I want to show you how to,

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,360
um, let me start from this. I want to show you how to get,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,080
um, invoices. So you go to LinkedIn,

7
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:27,600
my account, and then you click on the sales navigator icon here.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,280
And then you click this thing settings.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,800
And here this, uh, we have billing information.

10
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:41,360
So you past billing history and yeah,

11
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:45,360
we have this February two sales negator thing.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,120
And then what I do is just click print,

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,160
right? And yeah,

14
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:57,080
save it. And then from that I will just,

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,680
uh, I guess, uh, send it to you right now and then you'll do

16
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:05,920
the usual stuff. So that's how I get invoices from LinkedIn.
