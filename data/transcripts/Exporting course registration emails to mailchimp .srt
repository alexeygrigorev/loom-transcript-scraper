1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,390
I want to show you how to expert emails from,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,550
um, unstable.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,810
So we'll have a couple of courses where people would use the full air

4
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:14,220
table. So for example,  and others.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,380
So right now I need to go to this and they want

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:23,910
to save all these emails so that I click here on green to you

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,810
and click download, see the CSV.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,780
Well, this is the file.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,930
Then I select all these files and

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,860
I need to take towards

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,440
<v 1>Yes,

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,690
Yes. And then they are to trash.

13
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:55,550
So they're not pumping. And then the assistant pile,

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,150
we just upload it. We need to change it to change the name.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,840
So it will be 20 25, 27.

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,630
So this is the, the wrist.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,890
Now I need to move it to throw books,

18
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,140
books. I have a folder called courses that I will share with you.

19
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,800
And then, so here we talk about  and

20
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:27,480
I put the list here. Let me share the folder

21
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:31,860
with you. Sorry. Okay.

22
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:34,710
I'll share this after this. Okay.

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,840
And now we need to upload these things to MailChimp,

24
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,640
MailChimp

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,640
import contacts, and then upload a file.

26
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,920
So this one, typically you copy paste,

27
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:06,600
but this one has different bros

28
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,250
and this one would have two

29
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,490
books for USCIS respond

30
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,720
and organize, then update updating existing contacts.

31
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,690
Um, and that would meet

32
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,160
<v 1>Just once.

33
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,390
Um, now we need to specify techs. So for this farm,

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,300
the techs, um, this will be MLS.

35
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,960
Um, and to my lips was an income plan.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,290
This protects, um,

37
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,730
continuing for lunch. No,

38
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,730
it says that. Okay. Email.

39
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,940
So it cannot impart others. I don't know.

40
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,610
I seen bird competing birds.

41
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,150
Um, the, this how you input, and then once it's imported to MailChimp,

42
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,860
you take this one and he put this two o'clock folder and this folder

43
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:20,230
upload folder, we keep on doing those records that are uploaded.

44
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,390
Okay. So for this call, how you do this? I think I will actually

45
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:29,980
move this to Google, to Google drive and we'll will go

46
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,560
drive. It will be also, uh,

47
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,160
full the courses and then the name,

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,170
because you already have access to Google drive and it's tickets easier if you

49
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,730
just, um, we'll keep it there.

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,970
So let me just be in Google drive.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,010
So, um,

52
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,980
we have of courses,

53
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,020
but this is not the folder I want to use.

54
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,560
I want to use the folder mailing list. I will create for other courses

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,430
here. I'll just take all these things.

56
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,190
And so this,

57
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,020
uh, you will need to use this data looks pop made in these courses.

58
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,820
And then for example, you would need to put the files here.

59
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,980
All right. So the next one,

60
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,370
The Swan that we just uploaded, you would need to put it here and

61
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:37,820
then you would need to upload this to MailChimp. And once it's uploaded,

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,500
you would just put this to upload folder. Yeah.

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,110
This is how we do this with movies through Google drive to

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,500
keep everything in one place.
