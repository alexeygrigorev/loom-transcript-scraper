1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,690
And now I want to show you how to, um,

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,840
reach out to authors of open source libraries.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,670
So this is the library and they want to reach out to people

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,490
who work on this so they can come to open source spotlight and do

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,060
them about this. So this is the library I'll be

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,290
detect. And then to understand who works on this,

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,520
there's this contributors top.

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,320
So click on this. You let's

9
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:41,360
go with the first contributor. So I do a control

10
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:45,980
click, and then I'm trying to look for contact

11
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:48,590
information here. So usually, um,

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,750
you know, here we don't have contact information.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,450
So let me open the second one.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,690
So for the second one, at least we will have the name and we

15
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:03,020
have a website. So this is the contact information I was talking about.

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,930
So I open this block

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,370
of this guy and here we see you,

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,890
you see what email, or even if we don't this

19
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:20,450
link team that is Twitter. So there are different ways to reach out to

20
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:24,200
this person. So now we have a way to reach out to him.

21
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,030
So I'll go email and then I'll,

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,650
and then I'll just press you an email,

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,170
or it could be also LinkedIn connection request,

24
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:41,360
for example, um,

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,720
here, um,

26
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,360
I'll talk about, uh, so I want to invite them to even demo about,

27
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,140
um, this library.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,340
So I ,

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,790
I think I talk school.

30
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,540
Oh, okay.

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,770
Yeah. And now I want to say that open

32
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:32,870

33
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,780
give them most about their tools.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,440

35
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:47,330

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,570
