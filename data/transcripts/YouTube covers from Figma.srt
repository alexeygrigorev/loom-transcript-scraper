1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,090
Okay. Actually, I already have this video using Figma for creating even banners.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,690
So in this video, I show how to create that.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,940
But, uh, I also, I wanted to do this again because for

4
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:21,720
this event, um, if I go to  website,

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,720
so for this website,

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,460
AB testing, the cower is this

7
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:34,360
one? No, this is the

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,270
old one. So I want to create like in a new format and for

9
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:41,580
that, I'll need to go to Figma.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,540
I will need to also give you access to that.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,840
If you don't care for an accountant Figma, you will need to create it.

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,350
Yeah. I think this one,

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,770
no, this is not the right one.

14
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,170
Yeah. I think this, this is it.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,180
So let me look locate, and then I will

16
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,730
send you a copy of this thing.

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,030
So we'll call it data talks,

18
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:25,810
event binders, core funders.

19
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,170
So I'll share a link. So you don't need to actually

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,590
I've put this to the document, but yeah,

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,140
I think I will need to, to have your email,

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,990
once you register it in Figma.

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,950
Um, okay. I'll copy the link anyways.

24
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:02,780
So this will be the link that we'll send to you and

25
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:07,100
conduce. Yeah. So don't need these things.

26
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,350
Yeah. So I just want to give the things that we actually need for

27
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:18,110
events. Um,

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,630
the costs

29
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,550
and I will get off this one as well.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,400
Okay. So this was a forecast.

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,140
It was up. Uh, so for YouTube or podcasts resort,

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,590
I need to this one. Oops.

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,370
And then for webinars, we'll need this one.

34
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,240
Oops. And for open source

35
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:06,790
spotlight, this one,

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,660
this would be the cover. So,

37
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:14,950
and then the rest, I will leave them aside for now.

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,880
Oops.

39
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,890
Okay. I think I need to move them one by one.

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,430
Yeah. So we don't need them right now.

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,590
So forget about them two.

42
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,640
We need these three.

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,980
Come on. Okay.

44
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,290
Yeah. So there's three podcasts and spotlight

45
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,730
larger. Um, so the one we just heard was

46
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,590
a B testing and then

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,220
yeah. Usually if part of this shouldn't be blue.

48
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,880
I don't know why it's not undo. Uh,

49
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,480
I don't know why. Yeah. I know why it's not blue because I just

50
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,490
typed this. I don't know which one,

51
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,050
which part to make blue now, maybe I'll just select AB testing as

52
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,870
well. Yeah. To do this,

53
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:24,100
a new go to field. And then there are two costs that we can

54
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,160
select or if it's just one, so you can click on this and then

55
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:31,840
in document cloud color also suggest this one or

56
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:38,410
you can alternatively put 1 61 61 16 hex here and

57
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,240
yeah. So shouldn't be also centered.

58
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,920
Yeah. So yeah, you don't need to remember it next time you edited.

59
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,220
It will be centered I think. And now we need the name.

60
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,310
So yeah, the name is, uh,

61
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,760
Um, I don't know why it's coping.

62
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,020
Yeah.

63
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,030
And then, uh, yeah,

64
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,560
don't like it because it's, there's a lot of anticipation,

65
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,680
but for now we can just go with, you know, with that.

66
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,680
And then, um, I have coughs pictures here.

67
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,960
Yeah, of course. So here then I would just save

68
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:55,120
this image to my downloads from the website and

69
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,160
I will walk here two foot tall.

70
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,750
Uh, yeah, this control is here.

71
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,000
So then the few is image and then I will replace it with the,

72
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,770
which I just download it and

73
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,080
yeah. So no, let

74
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:22,430
me, yeah, probably I will make it a little bit larger.

75
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,900
No, 15.

76
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,990
Yeah. That's ups and this one.

77
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,370
Yeah. Like that. And now,

78
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,350
so I'll click on this thing now and expert PNG.

79
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,350
Yeah. And then now I will put it back to you and was it

80
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:58,180
118? So next time when I think here it's

81
00:06:58,181 --> 00:07:00,550
100 8179.

82
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,310
So next time if the title is long,

83
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,560
um, then yeah, it'll be shorter in the future.

84
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,950
Like is it's properly centered. Yeah.

85
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,800
I think now it is properly set, but it must be excreted.

86
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,850
Um, so I won't look to hundreds of 15 year expertise

87
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,560
and then to make sure that the next time when you have an event

88
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,810
title, that is the one, we have an event title that is a longer,

89
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
it's not too big. Okay.

90
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,140
So this is the picture and that

91
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,090
we validate that who will applaud to you?

92
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,000
Um, yeah, because it was a podcast event.

93
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,720
And then if it was ever been there in Danville,

94
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,510
would you use this one? Okay.

95
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:04,730
So now let me update this one and

96
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:05,480
click save.

97
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,770
Yeah. So this is how you update Figma,

98
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,960
uh, w this is how you update cover with using a template from Figma.

99
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,140
So in the future, I want to generate this automatically,

100
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,820
but, uh, it will probably take me some time to do is to automate

101
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:30,740
this. Um, yeah. So for now we can just replace it with Figma.

102
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,390
So we'll send you this link and next time you can

103
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,920
just use these things to oh yeah.

104
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,730
For the covers.
