So what we can do is we can go to Google and check how much, I don't remember what was the exact price for that invoice for YLABS. So you can take whatever price is there and create or update an invoice. And in this invoice you can just go to Google and then type whatever money in Euro and then convert it to USD and then take whatever sum was there and update the invoice to include USD and on this invoice use the IBAN from Revolut. Yes, so I'm not sure which IBAN they have. Maybe it's not the right one because I used to have a, I still have a private Revolut account and previously they used it for paying us. So this time we need to use Revolut from the company and maybe this is what they used last time. But you can just include this on the invoice and then send them an updated version to them. So the new updated invoice should have a USD sum there converted from Euros and then the Revolut IBAN there."

And the reason for that is because the way YouTube and Zoom integrate is in Zoom when we start streaming, only then we find out what is the YouTube ID or YouTube URL. So potentially, we can send the link to our channel right now or five minutes before the event we start the stream, usually it's five to ten minutes before the event, then we can send the link. And if somebody from their team is around, then they can make the post. Otherwise, I don't know, maybe they can just post the link to the channel. But you can tell here that we will tag weights and biases when we make the announcement. We'll make the announcements on social media and they can just retweet them, repost them."
audio_5@27-11-2023_15-30-31.ogg,5,2023-11-27 15:30:31,"So, I know that right now for Luma we use square banners, and previously we used rectangular banners for Eventbrite, and the thing is that the Eventbrite banners we use do not fit well to YouTube because we have these black strips. So I wanted to ask you to coordinate with Valeria to update the template we have for the banners, for the rectangular banners, so instead of using the old Eventbrite banners we update them to fit the YouTube dimensions, YouTube thumbnails, so then when we create YouTube thumbnails we don't have these black strips. Yeah, please check with Valeria about that."

So from Saturday till Friday, right? And then this way, like right now, this document is just too large. And it's very difficult to find things there. So then for summaries for statistics, I would check the spreadsheet. But for weekly reports, it would be convenient to use it in this form, right? Yeah."

So what you can do is find, we had this recent event, introduction to Data Engineering Zoom Camp. Just copy that and replace it instead of join us for a QA session. Write that the course is starting soon and maybe adjust the wording. So what we will do in this session is we will discuss the content of the course and we will answer questions. So yeah, that's roughly it. So this is what you can mention in the details. You can just go ahead and create the event and then send me the details for checking. But I think the important thing is not what is inside but actually that we announce it and then we can iterate on the content. For the picture, you can just take the same picture as we had but instead of saying introduction to Data Engineering Zoom Camp, just write Data Engineering Zoom Camp 2024. Yeah, that's all."

So, and Pink Matt, to find out what's his email, so you can set it up. You don't need to create any events, except, yeah, except you need to create an event in the Data Engineering Zoom Camp calendar. I don't know if you have access to that calendar.

And yeah, when you write to weights and biases with, yeah, maybe let's, yeah, let's create, I'll send another voice message. So I just lost my thought. So I wanted to ask you to ask Agata if they plan to have any more email campaigns this year. And if yes, ask her which slots they want to book because we are, so write something like this. Hi Agata, right now we are planning our activities for 2024 and we were wondering if you want to run any email campaigns with us. If yes, please let us know and we will book the slots for you.

Like for example, DoubleCloud, I don't think they, I'm not sure if they used a newsletter. Basically all the clients we had. Yeah, so the newsletter clients plus DoubleCloud, who else? Yeah, so let's compile a list with emails and names and also have created template. Like, hey, something like, hey, you run a newsletter campaign with us at some point. Now we're making plans for 2024. And yeah, let us know if you want to run any other campaigns with us, something like that. So let's create a template. Let's come up with a list and we should start sending these emails cause I look at the plan for the schedule for the newsletter and I see that, yeah, we need to fill a lot of slots.

And then I thought, wait a minute, like, why do we have two emails to Quack? And then I come, fuck, it's actually not Quack. So we need to be more careful. So when we write to clients, sponsors, potential sponsors, we also check the domain name. Like here is sahar, whatever, at iguazio.com. And then we need to make sure that the subject matches, actually matches the domain name, right? And then we send. I think we should start maybe preparing a process document for reaching out to sponsors with some templates. So let's start that. Mention that step. And yeah, we'll add more information there. Because I also want to start, like, we have this CRM with many, many things. And I want to start using it more. I've used it a couple of times recently. But I want to start using it more for finding sponsors."

I don't remember how much percent. Okay, for this one, let's not add percent, because previously the arrangements we had with them did not include any fees for processing the payment link, so just create that. And then, once it's ready, make sure that, in case they want to pay, not with the payment link, but with the address. It's the Revolute email.

So what you can write to both of them is, like, hi, name, thanks for your connection request and reaching out. I took a look at your profile and I found it quite interesting. So I was wondering if you'd be interested in being a guest at our podcast. And then you sent a link that you usually send that describes our events and a link to our podcast, datadogs.club.html, something like that. It's in the document, in the Google document. And let's create a new template. So this is for people who send a connection request to me, then this is something we can send them. And also, please send me the template we sent now.

Because like I'm trying for the second day in a row, I'm trying to change something. I should want to change the link, but I cannot.

So, but we add like 2% or however many, and then we can immediately send the invoice and ask them to, like the usual stuff you send for, like this template and so on. But probably we should create a different document so Quark does not see that. So let's create a copy so they don't see that there is somebody else editing the document. And I think let's send them the, like in half an hour, let's say, if nobody answers in half an hour, we can send them."

Because like we had this workshop, sponsored workshop, and there is the tick that people can mark, check if they want to share their email with sponsors. Because I don't remember seeing an email from us to them, so I just wanted to check if we actually did that. Yeah, and also for the other workshop that we had recently, was it from Curren AI? Yeah, I think it was Curren AI."
audio_40@18-03-2024_13-41-43.ogg,40,2024-03-18 13:41:43,"So, I don't think it was average, we usually have fewer viewers joining live. So maybe what you can do is you can share the live stats. Remember this graph that we sent to sponsors about the event? About the number of live joiners or like concurrent live viewers, I don't remember how it's called. So then maybe you can just take this one and then for comparison send a couple of screenshots from, I don't know, P Class 2 or 3, not the one that we had today. Oh, yeah, including the one that we had today and then like maybe take one from a month back, I don't know, and then show like this is yours and this is what we had and I think it was quite actually good for a podcast interview, so make sure that when we do this you only take podcasts. And then what you wrote in the email was that you wrote signups, registrations, so not the... Like I will read the message one more time."

So this is a very important distinction. And like, we also need to, like for Luma and Meetup, right? So you can just say this is number of registrants we had from Luma, from Meetup. This is how many people came to the live event. You can include a chart and you can say for comparison. So that one had that many live viewers. That one had that many live viewers. And then you can also include the number of views from YouTube. You can say, okay, look for now, you had this number of views and then take a few episodes from, I don't know, last month, podcast episodes. And you say, okay, this is the number of views they got. and yeah thanks for picking this up because like I completely missed that email even though I see myself in the recipients I don't know like I didn't see this email so thanks a lot for picking up picking that up and asking me for feedback"

In the meantime, I created two reminders. So the first reminder will go off every Friday. We already have one on Friday, checking with Dave and Pavel about podcast episodes. So there will be a different one, which reminds you to send a report, a weekly status report from previous Saturday. So please also include weekends because I know you sometimes do things on the weekend and I'm really grateful to you for doing that. But please include that. I know it's just a little bit of time, but I just want to know your total weekly hours, right? And then the other thing, I don't know if there is probably a better way. Please let me know if you have any ideas. But for making sure we don't miss anything, I created another reminder that goes off every working day from Monday to Friday. It will go together with this inviting people to Slack."

So for example, for sponsors, right? We know that maybe you can do it every Monday or I don't know, however you feel like, but like at least one per week, we need to check if there are any missing Trello cards. Like for example, we know that in three weeks, we will have an email, sponsored email, and we don't have a Trello card for that, create that, right? So then we make sure we don't forget that. And then every day go to the Trello board and go through the cards to see if anything needs to happen today, right? I know it's not the most effective way because we potentially, you will need to go through all the cards, click on each card and see what's inside. Of course, you don't need to do that every day because you'll probably know that, okay, probably for this card, I need to do that and that. But still, like my idea is that you open every day the Trello board and go through each card and see is there anything I need to do for that card today, right? And this way, we'll make sure that we don't forget to like send these emails and do other things like for sponsored workshops. This is very important to send a report or for newsletters also, it's very important to send reports, right? So we don't want to forget about these things. So we need to do them according to our processes. So for that, please go through all the Trello cards and make sure we don't forget to do anything. And then I know that it's not the most effective way, like maybe you can think of a different way of doing that. Like, I don't know, it would be nice to know like what kind of things we have in each of the trailer cards and then having a list of to-dos from these trailer cards for today. I don't know if there's a way to do that. It would be more effective. You would not need to go through all the cards. But for now, I don't know if there's a better way."
audio_46@24-03-2024_10-42-41.ogg,46,2024-03-24 10:42:41,"And please also When you do that, I want you to create two Process documents. So the first process document is for the first reminder. So record from the like you receive a Message in slack or I'm sorry in telegram saying you need to do that Then you take a screenshot of that then you show what exactly you need to do to Create your weekly report so which includes adding data to the spreadsheet and then adding data to the board document and creating a screenshot and sending it to me then What else a marking this is done in the spreadsheet with to do right? So all these steps, please create a process document for that And also for the second one for the second reminder Also include all the steps that you need to do Like for example check if there is any missing Newsletters, right So for that you go to the schedule you check if there's anything new then you update the trailer board Then you go through the existing Cards to see if there is anything missing If anything that you need to do today, so please document on all that and then also show how your market is done, right? So this way we will have documents that describe exactly how I need to approach that and then please send me these two documents For checking after you did them"

This is very important because This is how we earn money and we want to look professional. So we don't want to have an image of people who are sloppy, right, so please approach this carefully And of course, like when we talk to potential guests or guests or podcast guests, we also want to be careful, right? This is also important, but we need to make sure we approach that carefully too. But like when it comes to sponsors, this is how we earn money. So we need to double check that everything is good.

And you can say that this book is already available for free on the Databricks website. That's why it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make sense for us to provide five free copies. So we were wondering if instead of five free copies we can give them access to the O'Reilly Learning Platform. And ask here if it's okay."
audio_50@12-04-2024_13-27-43.ogg,50,2024-04-12 13:27:43,"Maybe add a little bit of context in case she doesn't remember that typically we give them five copies or three copies of the e-book, but as you wrote so at the end Write what you wrote"
audio_51@19-04-2024_11-19-02.ogg,51,2024-04-19 11:19:02,"So maybe I can share a tip with you So when I watched a video and then I want to make sure I don't forget anything from that video I don't know if this is useful for you. But this is how I do this personally. So I have a piece of paper and when I go through the video there is a like I Take notes of what I need to do from that video or what I want to remember what I want to put in some notes So maybe you can do something like that, so then you don't forget so you watch the video you take notes Right, and then you come back to those notes and this way you will not forget that I asked something, right? So then you will remember. Uh-huh, like you asked not to create a process document, but just give the context and link the long video just for example or Something else right. So sometimes I know that in one video I can ask you like three four or five things and It's very easy to forget to do one or two of them, right and if you do it this way, then Probably the chances that you will do this are lower, right? So this is just advice. Maybe you will find something else that works, but we just need to make sure that We don't forget things right so like I want to tell you something I want this to happen If it doesn't and I have to recheck What do you do? Like yeah, then I lose time you lose time then we're doing this and yeah, it's kind of not fun Okay, and thanks again for your work"

Because from what you wrote, it's not clear. Well, they will have to guess many things. And yeah, please make sure that the invoice is not just for VAT, but that this is the sum for the newsletter promotion plus VAT. So it should be like 1,500 plus 18 percent, something like that.

So with these Loom videos I record something usually and then I ask you to either do it or document it in a process document. So right now what you can do is go through the process documents that we have, at least just briefly understand what is there. And then for the to-do items, for the items that we did in the past, that are completed already, try to find what is the process document that is needed to complete this task. I will help you with that, but for now maybe try to find it out yourself. And then I'll take a look at what you found and say that okay, this is the right document or this is not the right document. And then also, yeah, you'll need to create a GitHub account and then there are some items in the to-do list, you can also check them out, but yeah, you'll need to know how to do them and for that you'll need to review process documents."

So when we arrange a podcast or some other event, what I do is, or what we do, is we first get an email of the speaker, and then we use email to arrange the things. So I will now forward you one of the conversations we had with a potential, or with a speaker, how it looks like, and yeah, maybe you'll find another process document that describes this process that we do through email. And if we don't, we will need to update the process document, because what you send is only partially correct, and it doesn't really reflect what we currently do."

So we have talked about this. And also like I'm thinking right now, this is something I wanted to ask you to do later when you finish the migration, like moving the documents from the shared folder to the shared drive. But now since you ask all these questions, it would be nice to capture my answers to these questions to somehow save them. So I think for this, right now for this template that you asked, please write what I responded. So then we have the context, when exactly we need to use. And in general, I want to have this for all the process documents. For the process documents, I want us to mention why we have this process and when to use them. Like what exactly, yeah, so why and when. So then there is clarity of what exactly why this document is needed. Because right now for process documents, I look at the document and it's just a sequence of steps, like with no real description of what exactly is happening, of why we need to do this. And the same with the templates. So right now the template is sent. Let's write, let's capture what I said and write it there when we use it, right? Like right now you don't have to do it for all the templates and all the process documents. But like when you have questions, like is this the right document or not, I'll record you either a video or a voice note. And then please start saving this information there too. I think actually like for the thing you sent for the screenshot like it already says when to use but we can definitely expand on that"

So sometimes I am available on Mondays evening so if this is somebody from the US the currently link that I have is not US friendly at all so if somebody from the Pacific time zone for them it's super early morning so for them I sometimes can do it in on Monday evening my evening right so then we can say okay how about doing it at for example 6 p.m Berlin time this is 9 I think uh so we can do it at 5 p.m or 6 p.m this is uh 8 or 9 pacific time zone and then if you say okay this time works what we can ask them to do is just use currently to book any random slot and then say okay I book this slot and we manually use our calendar a few notes here A few notes for that. So you need, in order to do that, you need to have access to my Google Calendar. I'll share it with you right now. And typically before you propose, you open my calendar and you see if anything is, if there is anything. And if there is nothing, then you can go ahead and schedule it. I'll record the video. And please like with everything I now share with you and explain. We need to keep track of that and record it somewhere so our process documents become more complete.

Is this something I need to do now or I can do it later And then you keep a note on that. So later you don't forget to come back to this Mmm, but would be nice if you listen to my voice notes now because they can contain information that you need right now So you listen you try to understand If it's something now later and then you're taking out and well, I just said This is just a recommendation for you not to maybe to feel less overwhelmed and the same with loom videos Many of them can contain information you need right now in order to do something Some of them will need to wait Regarding the invoice for So with open-source spotlight, I think I told you what you need to do what your next steps are This is something that can wait till next week. This is not urgent For the newsletter promotion that I mentioned. This is something you can do already If this is something that is not clear what do you need to do you can ask me Yeah, and Yeah, the same thing with other things like I think I sometimes mention if this is something I need to do now or later But if you're not sure you can just ask so for example for deals and CRM, this is something that can wait So for you, you can just now continue working on the onboarding document on Moving the process documents to the shared drive and And sometimes things that are a little bit more important or more important will pop up and then I'll clearly tell you that okay This is something that you should prioritize And then you simply come back to the other tasks I know that I'll keep kind of bombarding you with new things to do So I know that they may accumulate over time I hope it will not scare you that it can can look intimidating that if you look at the to-do list and it's It's like super large but Yeah, I I know that you just need time to learn how to do things and it's okay And if it becomes unmanageable, we will we will see how to actually deal with that Okay.

One thing though, that I don't know if the folks from Percival mentioned that, what we... So typically on Friday, we release a podcast episode. So Friday evening, my time. And then it's on Monday. So on Friday, we release a podcast episode and on Monday, we have a newsletter. So typically, we want to put a webpage about this podcast episode on our website. So it should happen between Friday and Monday. But because you are from Asia and your day starts earlier than our day, so technically, you can actually just do it on Monday morning, right? Or maybe you have 10 minutes of your time, you can do this on Saturday or on Sunday. But this is just for you to know that there is this little task that needs to happen between Friday evening and Monday morning."

audio_84@02-08-2024_21-00-41.ogg,84,2024-08-02 21:00:41,"As for the podcast, the way it works is first we, with the speaker, agree on time and we do it live. So at a specific time we go live, we stream it to YouTube, and then at the same time I record the podcast locally. And then we send it to Dave for editing. Usually it happens automatically, we just upload the mp3 files to Dropbox, and then Dave sees them, and they edit this, and they send us an edited version. Typically Dave writes us when it's ready, but also there is an automated email, automatic email that we get, and it's also added to the to-do list, I think. So then once we have that, we put this to Spotify for podcasters, so we schedule it for a specific time. Usually it's Friday, I don't remember, I think 7 p.m. Berlin time, something like that. I hope it's all in the process documents, you'll probably find all of that. And then we schedule it, and then on Friday it's released as a podcast episode, so yeah, we have it. And then once we have it on Spotify for podcasters, it automatically publishes it on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iTunes I think, and some other platforms. So then we need to get the links from these platforms, and then put them in a specific form, and then this way we create a page. And this page needs to be included in the newsletter, right? So the thing you would need to do between Friday evening and Monday morning is this, what I just said, publishing a page. So typically you just need to get the links from Spotify and Apple Podcasts, put them in a form, and YouTube, put them in a form, and then execute one thing on GitHub, there is of course a process document for that, and that's pretty much it. So it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes of your time. But also what I just described, I think it's in the templates, in Trello templates, so the entire process. As you get into this with time, I think you'll understand. So I hope it gives enough context for now."

It would be nice to at least show up for, let's say, 30 minutes, because there could be urgent tasks that when I say you need to do, it's good if you do it on the next, as soon as possible, but not right now, so it's okay if you do it on the next day, right? But typically, most of the tasks, they are not urgent, so it's okay, like, for example, one day you don't work and then you work on the next day. It's totally fine, right? So, again, it's up to you how you distribute your work and sometimes it may happen that you on one week, you don't have enough work for all 20 hours. It's also totally fine. It might happen and there is nothing wrong about that. Okay, I'll send you an invite."

This is a bit easier for me to understand. And then also at the end, please write total hours that you worked. So the reason I need it is for me to better understand, like if I can add more tasks to you, like to see when you're less busy, then I can think, okay, like I see that you finish everything and you still have work, then perhaps I can add something more, like maybe think of other tasks for you."

So for the podcast, we schedule it live, yes, and then we do it on YouTube. At the same time, I record it locally. So locally, there is an mp3 file that I upload to Dropbox. When we do that, Dave, our podcast editor, should automatically see it. If he does not, I think typically we also let him know that there is a new podcast episode. I don't think it's necessary because he gets an invite. He gets a notification about that. So I don't think you need to reach out to him. So there is a process. He will just let you know that, yeah, it's done. But also, there is a special notification email. I recently forwarded you that email. So you will be receiving those emails when Dave uploads something to the Dropbox folder. We will receive a notification, you, me, and it also goes to the to-do list. Then you take the mp3 file, the edited file, and upload to Spotify for Podcasters. Yes, and it distributes it to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, whatever automatically. And then you get the links after it goes live. So before, when you schedule, you don't have the links. When it's published, when it goes live at 5 or 7 p.m. Berlin time on Friday, only then you will have a link to Spotify and Apple Podcasts. You will not have the links before, only after. So that's why you need to get these links and fill in the form. You perform the GitHub task, create a page. But yeah basically that's it. Also talk to Valeria because she might have an idea how exactly you can pre-fill it in the best possible way. And then of course once you agree on the way it should be done we should document everything. So now you're getting familiar with the process documents but soon I think you'll know your way around them more or less. And then this is when you should probably keep track of things you now learned somewhere. Included maybe also in the onboarding document. But then yeah you come back to those processes and you revise them. We will also do document by document. We will check them how relevant and up to date they are. So we will do this soon too."

Another thing we should improve is, so right now all our process documents focus on how to do something, not about why and when, right? I think I already mentioned that. So let's, for this document, what we should write is this. So first, we want to understand why we need to do this. So why is our community members want to have access to the Slack data so they can do some analytics, et cetera, right? So this is why. And that is why we do monthly data dumps so they can have access to the fresh data from Slack. Then another thing is when to do this, so you do this every month when there is a reminder and this is exactly how you create it, right? So for this one and for others I want to have context so then it's clear why this document exists, why this process exists, why we should do this, not just how. And also what I just said about that process documents should be complete and that the process documents should explain why, not just what, why and when. Please add this to onboarding document too, so then I don't need to say it again, right, so it's just documented there."

I don't know if you want me to do to edit to-do or maybe you want to manage it yourself like because probably right now you're busy with something else but I want to make sure that things I say don't slip through the cracks. For example with the dump I think I asked you to do it earlier and then I had to remind to do this again so I'd rather not do this and trust you that you don't need reminders and for that we need to think about right now it's okay it's not a problem I know you're overwhelmed and there are a lot of things you need to do and learn but we need to think about a way where I don't need to remind you about things because like I also for me it's hard to keep track of everything so perhaps when you hear to do you can do edit to do to the to-do list yourself or I know we can think about another way so let me know what you think about that

I don't know if you can do this from the mobile app, but you probably don't need to do it from the mobile app. So you open the desktop version, and there's an option to download the files. And then you can transcribe these files. I'll tell you how. I'm from mobile right now, so you'll need to adapt it to desktop, but I'll record something. And then you will need to create a process document for transcribing audio files. And then later, when you have the transcription, you can ask ChatGPT to summarize the transcription."

We can simplify it. I am talking about the context you wrote. So maybe let's first split it into why and when, like exactly like I told you in the voice note."
audio_111@06-08-2024_13-52-46.ogg,111,2024-08-06 13:52:46,This is just for me so I can easily read it and record the voice note at the same time.

Then, when it comes to the text, the Slack data dump process is performed monthly to provide community... This is too formal. What exactly did I say there? Can you please check and use these words? Like, we don't want to be too formal. It's okay to use just common speech. Common language. Then, Slack data dump process is performed monthly to provide community members with up-to-date Slack data. Okay. I don't think I said for analytics and insights, I did not say that. This ensures that data remains fresh and relevant, supporting effective decision making and analysis. I don't think I said that either. The process is triggered by a monthly reminder, highlighting the importance of maintaining... Like, highlighting the importance, I don't think I said that to you. Could you please try to stick to what I said? And, like, to me, maybe for you it will take some time to understand what we should include there, what we should not. It's okay. It will take time. But, like, I want each word to make sense. Right? And, like, for me, highlighting the importance of maintaining accurate and timely data access, it does not convey... It does not have any useful information there. Right? So, let's try to include only things that are needed and not repeated. Because we... In this part, we repeated quite a lot. Right? So, please, listen to what exactly I said and use that. And then with time, you will be able to write it yourself using the language I want to use."
audio_113@06-08-2024_13-56-05.ogg,113,2024-08-06 13:56:05,"So I took a look at the entire document, it looks fine, please don't use BOLD there, like I don't understand what it means, so we don't really need to use BOLD for formatting, and apart from that, looks okay."
audio_114@06-08-2024_14-17-37.ogg,114,2024-08-06 14:17:37,"I quite often send voice notes, so maybe what I just showed you will be useful. And also, like, when I say something in the voice note, typically I want, like, let's say with this why and when, I want not to deviate too much from that. So ideally, when you have a transcript for you, it's actually easier to use the language I use. And also, again, you can use ChargeBT to make it more structured. Because when I say in voice note, it might be not as structured when we just transcribe it and put it to the document. So use ChargeBT to make it more structured."

So first we create a Luma event, and then it doesn't matter if we create a next one on Meetup. So Meetup is also a platform where people can discover events and sign up for them. So we use Luma and Meetup. Before it was Eventbrite and Meetup, and now it's Luma and Meetup, we don't use Eventbrite anymore. And then for the calendar, yeah, we create a calendar event. And sometimes people don't want to sign up for individual events, they just want to see, to have all events in the calendar, right? So they don't need to sign up for anything. And for them, we maintain a calendar. So that's why. And in the calendar, in case they actually do want to sign up, we want to include the Luma link so they can discover it, right? That's the idea. Again, summary. First you create a Luma event, and then it can be just a calendar or Meetup. And then for calendar, what I would call it is not just calendar, but let's say DataTax Club events calendar. So then it's more clear what exactly it means, what kind of calendar it is, right? Because calendar can mean many things. And also maybe that's why I have a confusion, because there are not three calendar events, right? It's just one, right? Okay, so I hope it clarifies it. As for Eventbrite process documents, when we move them to the new shared drive, let's just not move them. Let's just ignore everything that is related to Eventbrite. We don't move them. They can stay in the old Google folder."

So sometimes when people do not respond with bio, we take a genetic bio. There should be a process document for that. Maybe you can try to find it. But the idea is we just simply take whatever is on their LinkedIn and use that as a bio. We can probably refine it a little bit. We can try to use chatGPT for creating a bio based on their LinkedIn profile, for example. Right now, we just take whatever they already wrote in LinkedIn if they don't respond. So please check it, try to find this document. And yeah, sorry I was not, I didn't reply to your messages because I just missed them. So if it happens, I would appreciate if you just remind me."

But I think what we can do is try to ask Johanna to also do that when she comes up with questions. So typically the process is like that. So first we try to find a guest, agree on the time and once we have a yes from them that they do want to participate regardless of whether we agreed on time or not, we share, we create a podcast document and add Johanna to conversation saying hey Johanna here is a process document or here is a podcast document. And she starts working on that. Lately there was a problem that we have delays with that so we delay this document until it's quite late. So I want to fix that and once we have, once we agreed on having a guest ping Johanna immediately and ask to maybe we can ask her when she can complete it. So then the idea is we want to announce an event as early as possible so more people can sign up and if we delay it till the very late then few people sign up and join the event. So maybe in one of the emails, the first ones that you write to Johanna once we agree with somebody's hey Johanna there is a new process document can you please let us know when you can work on it. We want to publish it as soon as possible so we can get more signups for the event and we can also ask her when she finishes the questions to also think of title, of a title for this and heal the like points because then this way will be much easier for you to just put this information to Luma and not think about that."

I sent you some other day for doing that, so we need to add the amount on that day. Sometimes I will send you screenshots, so when, let's say, I pay in USD, but I get a notification from my bank saying how much it was in Euros, so then I will just send you a screenshot, so then you, when you fill this document, the bookkeeping document, you will add the actual Euro amount to. I'm still not following. So she, Ella, wants to do it in September, not in August, correct? And in September all the slots are occupied by other speakers, by other guests, right? So if this is the case, we can say that we cannot... Or like just open my calendar, you should have access to my calendar and maybe pick a date like Monday or like some other day that is available right now and you can just put it there. It's also possible. Or we can offer her a date on some day in October, for example, right? So usually we do one event per week, I mean one podcast event per week.

So what we should do is since we already have an email, we should use a template that somebody mentioned that they want to participate in our event. It doesn't have to be a podcast. So it might be podcast, might be a webinar. So we need to tell them, hey, Antonis referred you as a potential speaker. So we can do a podcast, we can do a workshop. Then you send them the document. You probably have seen the templates. Maybe there is already a template for what I say. I'm pretty sure there is. And then you can tell them, okay, these are the options. This is the document that describes here that potential. Yeah, and then once they said that yes, they are interested and they want to do a workshop or they want to do a webinar or they want to do a podcast, then depending on what they want to do, we either start the podcast process or the webinar process."

We need to go through FinOM and through Revolut and see if some of the expenses are not booked. We don't have records in our bookkeeping spreadsheet. And it's very important, it's very important, it's super important that we also have all the income. So if we had some income and it's not reflected in bookkeeping and we forget to report it, it's actually, it's a crime, right? So it's withholding some information about income. So this is super serious. So this is why we need to go through FinOM and Revolut and see if there are transactions, incoming transactions, even if there are, and they are missing in the bookkeeping spreadsheet, we need to add them. Please go through process documents, see if we have something like that of what I'm talking about or not. And if not, we should have a document that describes that, because this is very important."

So what we can do is maybe you go through all the process documents we have for tax reporting and then based on what I said, we form it the right sequence. We can also write it in some Google document, I don't have, I don't think we have it captured, written anywhere, so we should do this. And something similar to a checklist in Trello, we can create a Google document and then once I say everything is good, then yeah, we can do it. I don't think there are specific sequences mentioned anywhere."
audio_130@12-08-2024_18-09-28.ogg,130,2024-08-12 18:09:28,"Well, typically the process is you open the bookkeeping report for a specific month, so there is a date added. This is what we use for splitting between months. And then first there are to-dos, so you go through to-dos. So usually you go to Dropbox, you open the documents, the receipts, the invoices, and then you fill it, replace to-dos with the actual numbers. That's the first part, the first step. Second step is if there are USD or other non-euros, you convert them to euros using the website I gave you. Then once it's done, you go to Revolut and Finom and double-check that we don't have any missing expenses or, what is more important, missing incomes, incoming transactions. And then if there are... By missing I mean we actually have a transaction, but it's not in the bookkeeping spreadsheet. So then we add it there. And then once it's done, you go through that process document that you sent, meaning that we prepare the zip archive and upload it to that website I sent you through email. And then we write an email to our accountants saying that the report for this month is ready. Also, when it comes to invoices, we have two folders for invoices. One invoice is like this is the expenses. So this is what we spent. You will also see invoices from Prosilum and basically everything we spent money on. And then the other folder is invoices that we sent. So this is our incoming transactions. So there are two folders. And then there is another folder which is invoices lending, I think. This is when you... I think it was the other process document you mentioned when you just put the file in Dropbox and then it appears in... It tells it to do the spreadsheet. Well, I think that's more or less it. So let's prepare a document where we capture the sequence and we link to this document from the onboarding document. So it's there. And then for each step in this document for preparing this thing, the report, we should link to the relevant process documents."

I don't know about the rest. I guess this is new guest registers Please make sure it's a part of the process document
audio_145@15-08-2024_16-04-52.ogg,145,2024-08-15 16:04:52,"Also, don't forget to update Meetup and the Google Calendar, the community Google Calendar."
audio_146@15-08-2024_16-22-37.ogg,146,2024-08-15 16:22:37,"So you probably know, I just wanted to make sure I say it. So when I mean calendar invite, calendar event, so I mean the Data Talks Club community calendar, the Google calendar that is for the community members, but we also have calendar invites that we send for the guests and for me. So I have it on my calendar, right? So the one you just updated was the one for guests, and usually it is five minutes earlier than the actual thing. And then for the community calendar, this is at the time when it actually starts."
audio_147@19-08-2024_07-02-53.ogg,147,2024-08-19 07:02:53,So usually as you saw Ella kinda I think she requested to move the podcast episode I am not sure but like probably so what we do in this case is when we have not agreed on a date yet but the event is happening today what we do as soon as possible is just move to some random date in the future in Luma and meetup and calendar so people don't have it on their calendars so they know it's not happening while we are agreeing on a new date it's also important to move it as soon as possible so people don't receive notifications because otherwise they would receive a notification saying that event is starting like in 15 minutes so they join and they don't see anything so that's frustrating and also on some platforms I think on meetup maybe on Luma too if we move if we don't move an event and it started then we cannot move it anymore we need to create a new one which is problematic because for that one people signed up for the new one they did not so we will need to ask them somehow to sign up again so that is why we need to when events are being scheduled on that day when it's happening and we need to find a new date this what I do just find some random date in the future and schedule all the on all the platforms this event to some random future date while we agree on the new date yeah I think we should create a process document for that if we don't have it where we describe it
audio_148@19-08-2024_09-22-22.ogg,148,2024-08-19 09:22:22,"I think I already told you how you should approach that. I'll just repeat it just in case. So, 9am Pacific Time Zone is 6pm Central European Time. So usually I try to avoid having things on that time. So what I can do, and usually if I need to do it somewhat late, like 5, 5.30, 6pm, I prefer to do this on Mondays. So Wednesday, Thursday, Friday are no go for that. So usually I am not available after 3pm my time. And if this is something after 5pm, this is for Open Source Spotlight, if this is something after 5pm, I only can do this on Mondays. And you can see my calendar on which Mondays I am free to do that. And what you can do is you can ask if they can do this on a 30-day time and suggest a time slot. And if they can't, ask on which Monday they can do 9am."
audio_149@20-08-2024_10-44-41.ogg,149,2024-08-20 10:44:41,"So exactly when it's set for today, so when it's set for today, but the speaker bounces for whatever reasons We don't have time to agree to a future day right now We need to move the data up and then start agreeing because if we don't then we risk like all the things that I described in that voice message"
audio_150@20-08-2024_11-21-52.ogg,150,2024-08-20 11:21:52,"I don't understand the question like how an invoice cannot be in Phenom if you create it in Phenom? So let's say you... I'll take an example. So right now we are talking with AirByte. Remember you sent an email to John the other day about the newsletter. So if a newsletter goes through, if they actually buy this, if they decide to sponsor us,"
audio_151@20-08-2024_11-22-54.ogg,151,2024-08-20 11:22:54,"It was a bit noisy, so I... Okay, let me continue. So if they decide to sponsor us, what we do next is, well, we arrange everything for the newsletter, but at the same time, we start the, I guess we call it the invoice process or whatever. So we first get their information about, like, the company, name, address, and so on. And then we create an invoice in Phenom, and then we send them the invoice for payment. So this is how it works. So, like, that's why the question, like, creating an invoice when it's not yet in Phenom, doesn't make much sense, because, like, you create it in Phenom, and then it stays in Phenom. So if it's not in Phenom, you need to create it there, I guess. And this is the only place where we create invoices. And why did you ask that?"

Invoices that we get, or receipts, we do not put them to Finom, if this is your question. So, typically we create invoices, we save invoices from FIDOM to Dropbox is when we prepare this report, monthly report. So then we just simply go through paid invoices. If an invoice is paid, then we put this to Dropbox and then send it to our accountants. Also, please make sure that everything I say is somehow captured somewhere. So, like, maybe in some sort of document, so this information is not lost."
audio_155@20-08-2024_12-27-57.ogg,155,2024-08-20 12:27:57,"So, when we pay for a product or a service, we get an invoice or a receipt. So, this is confirmation that we made the payment and this is what we use. This is what we need to send to accountants. So, this is a proof that we indeed paid the money. So, this is our expenses. So, I can call them incoming invoices or I don't know if it's the right name or not. And outcoming invoices is what we send to our clients. So, in my example, with AirByte, if they decide to sponsor our newsletter, then we send them an invoice. I usually just say invoice. But in this case, we send them an invoice. This is the invoice in the terminology I used. This is an outcoming invoice. It's coming from us to them and they have to pay for it. So, the flow is we send the invoice, then they pay."
audio_156@20-08-2024_12-29-31.ogg,156,2024-08-20 12:29:31,"And, for example, for invoices that we receive, there are two kinds of invoices, or not kinds, but sometimes we get an invoice and then we have to pay for the invoice. That's the first sort. And the second one is when we already paid, let's say, using a bank card or something like this, like in case with OpenAI, this is the case. We first pay, and then as a proof of payment, we get the invoice, or sometimes there is a receipt. And usually, like when we have both invoice and receipt, we're interested in the receipt. So for example, in case of OpenAI, we usually have a receipt, so we don't need the invoice. And for example, ProSilo is also, we get a receipt in many services, we have a receipt. So this receipt is just as a proof of payment, it's enough. But sometimes we get just an invoice, no receipt, and it's also fine. And in cases when we first get an invoice, then we need to pay for this invoice. And only then, once we paid, we declare this invoice, we put it to the bookkeeping spreadsheet and Dropbox folder."

Usually, either I already pay and just get an invoice as a result of that, or, yeah, I pay it myself. So, for example, from Valeria, when I get an invoice from Valeria, then, yeah, I just pay it myself. Because you also don't have access to all the tools. So, I use VICE for that. It doesn't matter. Many things I do myself. And then, what you need to do is just declare the expenses, make sure they are in the spreadsheet. And usually, if something is in the spreadsheet, it's already paid. And when you need to pay for something, then I explicitly ask you to do that. And then there is a process document for doing that, how you need to pay in FINOM.

And in VICE, we can select a specific date at which the transaction happened. Specific day. And then we can know the rate, exchange rate, on that day. Because with Google, it gives you the exchange rate today, but that thing was in the past. For now, actually, maybe it's okay. I don't think it changed significantly over a month. But please update the process document. Or we actually should create a new process document that shows how to convert currencies with historical rates. And then we can simply link that process document in the process document you show in the screencast video. I think the deleted one was a duplicate, accidental duplicate, so please remove the line from the spreadsheet."

So if there was a payment in Finom or Revolut but it's not there, we need to add it and also make sure we have an invoice for that in Dropbox. And likewise, if there is incoming money, it's very important to also declare this. I think I mentioned that this is super important, more important than anything else, that we do not forget to include any income we received. So please go through Finom and Revolut and see what are the transactions for that month and if there are any transactions that are not in the spreadsheet. Not all the transactions are in Finom and Revolut, because sometimes I pay from my personal card, sometimes I make... Like sometimes payments do not come from Revolut or Finom and this is fine, but like if there is any incoming things, we need to make sure they are in the bookkeeping document."

Like very similar to, or like even better, maybe let's create a template in Trello that step-by-step describes what exactly we need to do, right? And then, like for you, next time you do it, you just clone a template and you just tick all the boxes until it's done, then it should be way easier for you to follow that."

So we select only those who ticked that checkbox So for that one, we should check which one we haven't uploaded, but we should do this too for every event. And I'm not sure if Francis was doing this or not, so we will need to check to look back and see for which events we did not do this and retroactively do this for past events. So for now add this to Todo and for now only do it for all the new events. But yeah, we will do this in the future. So instead of Eventbrite, it should be Luma, but with Luma it's possible to do all that. No, Pavel does not work with us anymore."

Don't don't just send them all we have Right. We don't want to show them that we're kind of too available that there are too many open slots, right? so we don't want that and with the workshop the same like ask them what they When they want to do this and then we can pick any of the Tuesdays for that"

So you need to go there open it and verify that this is actually online not offline and there is a link to our YouTube channel and not some random link.

And yeah, please check with Valeria what should be the templates for these announcements. But we definitely should make posts on LinkedIn and on Twitter about the events we schedule. And yeah, it's okay. What I want to say is please also update the templates so they are up to date because they might not be right now. For Twitter I think you should have login credentials right now, they were shared in the chat with Valeria, but if you need me to put any code to share any code with you or share anything let me know."

Because this needs to happen every week. And we're a bit behind with some unpublished podcast episodes. So please don't forget to schedule the next episode. I think we should have some edited files already. Yeah, let me know if we don't. Because there was a break, like one month maybe. We might not have any edited podcast episodes. But at least check. And if we do, schedule the next one for Friday, meaning today, 7 p.m. And be careful with the time zone. And also make sure we have the podcast transcription for the one and a podcast page for the previous one with Christopher. And also, you can already prepare the podcast transcription for the new one that you're about to schedule today.

What do I need what I needed? I do not need to document Like extra information that is not in process documents that are more like contextual to give context You can for now just put it to like I saw you already put it to your notes Also in the onboarding document, we will figure out how to structure the onboarding document later But like I just want to make sure that everything I say is not lost So you if you don't need know where to put the information that might be important just put it to the onboarding document and then we will find the better place for this or maybe just create a Document with notes where you put your notes and then for each piece of information We will figure out what's the best place where to put it But I just want to make sure that like when I record something a video or a voice note That it gets documented it gets saved somewhere. So then I don't need to say it again and when we Let's say I want to hire help for you like get a second person that the the idea I have in mind is that they just can go through these documents and Have all the context all the information That they need so they will not need to struggle as much as you do with all this Like mess that we have right? So we just want to have more organized and all the information that I say I Want to organize it in such a way that it's easily accessible and readable. So the person can independently read that and Perhaps maybe define it if something is not clear.

So they are usually from Monday to Thursday, and then on Friday we announce the winners. Sometimes it takes a bit more time, so it's from Monday till Friday. The idea there is not like a live event, but it's just a time when people can go to Slack and ask the questions, ask the authors some questions and they answer. So this is a synchronous event, unlike other events. So yeah, please update the process documents so it's clear how to do that."

We can just send it as is and our accountants will figure it out. The one that you find confusing, I think this is either when we converted some money from USD to EUR, could be one explanation. Another explanation could be when when our clients pay with a credit card and the money gets to a so-called merchant account and we need to get this money out of this merchant account to the main account, Revolute account. We can have that. And in Finom we also see transactions from Revolute, not always, but sometimes. Sometimes it stops working, so we also need to check Revolute to make sure there are no missing transactions, but this one is a Revolute one because there is this R icon. So yeah, you can continue preparing the invoice, even though there are discrepancies with the dates, it's fine. As long as the PDF is there, it's fine.

What we do is we ask them to send us a link about the book and then from the link we get everything. I think there are process documents that describe how to get an image, how to like how to exactly fill the form. So as long as we have either a name of the book or the link to the book page, we can find everything we need and usually if we have the name of the book we just look it up in Google and find all we need."

Instead of sending them a zip archive, like it says in the process document, we need to upload that archive to using a special link. I have sent you that link, you can also find it in your email, I have forwarded you. We probably have to do somewhere to update this process document, so please find that and update the zip archive and then also reply to the email saying, follow up on that email saying that, yeah, we also uploaded the zip archive to the, like I don't remember how this link is called, but there."

So here Marissa sent an invite, but what you need to do is, I don't know if for you now makes sense to go back and try to find what I told you last time, I'll just simply repeat. So you use the Calendly link for scheduling, you schedule it to any random time, or you can ask the guests to schedule on any random time, because they need to fill in some information. And then there's also a Zoom link, which is important, because it has to be our Zoom link, so we have the recording, and then you simply, once it's created, you simply move it to the time we agreed, right? So please do that, and while I'm not rejecting this one, for actual, until you create it, and when you create it, I can reject it and we'll just use what you created, or what they will create and you move, okay? And we should have some sort of process document, because I already described you this, I'm describing it again, I don't want to, like we should just have it in writing somewhere, so I don't need to say it again.

The process is first we just want to approach a person, reach out to them and ask if they are interested in general.

Usually Is you sent a connection request with a note and in the note you wrote You write something like hey your profile looks very interesting We want to invite you for podcast slash workshop slash webinar in our case. It's a workshop Where we want to talk more about your experience are you interested in learning more something like that
audio_191@27-08-2024_12-36-14.ogg,191,2024-08-27 12:36:14,"There should be a process document that describes how to add ads in general like promotions and Perhaps we can have a similar one for influencer marketing if you think it's necessary What I want to do is to have them discoverable, so let's say when you look for something We can easily find what you need so We can maybe think how to make that one discoverable when you have a task like the one I sent"

Also for ParadeDB please take a look at the messages before you edit because there are... Yesterday took a bit of time to get started so you need to cut out quite a lot. So you need to look for something like here we actually start and you need to remove pretty much everything before except the introduction but I think you'll figure it out once you start on that."
audio_194@27-08-2024_13-25-05.ogg,194,2024-08-27 13:25:05,I just forwarded you a message for a newsletter promotion. This is what we usually start two weeks before. We probably have a process document. So there what we do is we first create a copy of a template and I think you can see how we do it. And then we also attach this visual guide. I don't like that we actually attach it. I think what we can do is upload it to our shared drive and make it public for everyone and then just share the link. So for now you can just send it to Amit with attachment but later please let's revise the template and also include it as a link because it's heavy. We don't want to send it in attachment every time. So probably it's better to just put it to a link and share the link.
audio_195@27-08-2024_13-34-49.ogg,195,2024-08-27 13:34:49,"Also, I want you to focus this week on getting through all the podcast stuff, especially the transcription part, because we are slowly getting back on speed with all the podcast episodes. So I hope soon we'll have at least one podcast episode per week. And this is probably one of the most complex things we have. So it would be good if you don't feel overwhelmed about that anymore. So yeah, please make this a priority to figure this out. And also, of course, like there are other things that are important, especially everything that is related to sponsors. So that is even more important, but then please make the podcast a priority and then the rest. We still have some time for submitting our next tax declaration. I think we can do it next week. So for this week, let's try to figure out the podcast stuff. And then for the tax declaration next week, I hope it will be easier for you. And then as I said, stuff with sponsorship usually takes priority over everything else. Which means like answering Amit and sending them the documents is the most important thing right now. By documents, I mean this visual guide, and then you figure out the podcast stuff and then everything else. And yeah, please don't forget to send me reports. I just want to know if you're stuck with something and yeah, I'll be happy to help."
audio_196@29-08-2024_20-19-30.ogg,196,2024-08-29 20:19:30,"I just noticed that you added the ParadeDB video to the open source spotlight playlist. We shouldn't add it there until it's fully ready. So I removed it from there. It's fine, don't worry. So the process is we upload it as unlisted, we send the link to the guests, they take a look. Of course, it should be an edited version, the one we send it. They take a look, they see if anything should be further edited, if not, they just send us the timestamps, right? We update the timestamps, we put the timestamps to the video, we schedule it and only then we add it to the playlist, okay? Please update the process documents so they reflect that. Or maybe there should be like a separate overview page with the process for open source spotlight where you can mention that."

"audio_199@02-09-2024_09-58-02.ogg,audio_200@02-09-2024_09-58-22.ogg","199,200",2024-09-02 09:58:02,"So the process is, you need to create a copy, like a special, we have a template, a document. You create a copy and then you send them and they fill it in. I think I forwarded you an email a while ago from Francis, so check how he did, so he created a copy and then he also included a PDF document and I asked you to upload this PDF document somewhere and instead of sending the PDF, send the link. Right now you can just send the PDF. Do this as soon as possible because we should have done this last week and they're still waiting for our response. and so in these cases when you are not sure what to answer please let me know as soon as possible do not wait for one week when I ping you you need to be practical"
