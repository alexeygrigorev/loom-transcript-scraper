9. Import data sources in Grafana

Within the virtual environment, navigate to Grafana and run the initialization script to create the necessary data source and dashboards.

10. Run tests

Execute the testing script to randomly query the application, verifying that the responses are accurate and relevant. 

11. Monitor results

Regularly check Grafana dashboards for insights into application performance and usage metrics. 

The process ends with a review of the application's features and capabilities, ensuring everything functions as intended.
