Checking Availability for Rescheduling Events

What: Check calendar for availability when someone requests to reschedule an event.

Why: To ensure effective scheduling and avoid conflicts when rescheduling events.

When: When asked to reschedule an event or meeting.

1. Access the Calendar

Open a web browser and go to people.brightmind.com to view the calendar.

2. Identify Availability

Review the calendar for empty slots where there are no existing engagements. Note any available time slots.

3. Verify Requested Dates

When someone requests a rescheduling, check their suggested dates against your availability on the calendar.

4. Propose New Dates

If a suggested date works, confirm it. If not, propose an alternative date and time that is available.

5. Allow for Flexibility

Consider lunchtime meetings if necessary, as those slots are generally open, despite being marked busy.
