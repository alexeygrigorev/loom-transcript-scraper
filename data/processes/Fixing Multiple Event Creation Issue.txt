Fixing Multiple Event Creation Issue

What: Create reminders for a multi-day event.

Why: To ensure participants receive daily reminders about ongoing activities during a week-long project.

When: Reminders should be scheduled and sent ahead of the event.

1. Identify Event Details

Determine the specifics of the multi-day event, including the start date, end date, and key activities for each day.

2. Create Reminder Emails

Manually create seven different reminder emails for each day of the event. Use the existing template from past events for consistency.

3. Schedule Emails

Set the emails to be sent out at appropriate intervals throughout the event week, ensuring they provide timely reminders to participants.

4. Update Process Documents

Revise the process document to reflect the new method of using email reminders instead of multiple events. Include links to any relevant videos and templates used for the email reminders.

5. Review and Finalize

Send the updated process document and email templates for review to ensure all information is accurate and complete before implementation.
