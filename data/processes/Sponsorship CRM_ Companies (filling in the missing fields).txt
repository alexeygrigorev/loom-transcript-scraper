Sponsorship CRM: Filling in the Missing Fields

What: Update company status and relevant details in the Sponsorship CRM.

Why: To ensure proper categorization of companies and maintain relevant contact information, which aids in prospect management.

When: Whenever new companies are added to the Sponsorship CRM or when existing company information needs to be updated.

1. Add Status

Determine the company's status. If no status is assigned, categorize them as "prospects."

2. Remove Unused Entries

Identify and remove companies that do not have any relevant content assigned to them.

3. Update Relevant Details

For established contacts, fill in the relevant information such as:

- Company relevance based on the content
- Website URL
- LinkedIn profile
- Optional: Additional social media accounts (e.g., Twitter)

4. Evaluate Text Usage

Assess the importance of the text field. If it proves unnecessary, consider removing it in the future.
