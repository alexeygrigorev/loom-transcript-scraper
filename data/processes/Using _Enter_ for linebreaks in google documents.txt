Using Enter for Line Breaks in Google Documents

What: Proper use of line breaks in podcast documents

Why: To ensure clarity and appropriate formatting in text, avoiding confusion in content structure.

When: Use this process when formatting podcast documents.

1. Use Enter for Line Breaks

Press Enter to create a new paragraph, ensuring that each paragraph is distinct and selected individually.

2. Avoid Shift + Enter

Do not use Shift + Enter, as this retains the text within a single paragraph, leading to potential confusion during editing and readability.

3. Check for Common Sense Corrections

Before finalizing, review the document for any statements that may not make logical sense. Highlight and correct any unclear or inappropriate wording for clarity.

4. Review the Document Before Interviews

Make it a habit to check the document for proper formatting and clarity before each interview to prevent confusion for the guest.
