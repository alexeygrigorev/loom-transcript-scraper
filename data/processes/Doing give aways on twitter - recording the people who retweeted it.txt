Doing Giveaways on Twitter - Recording the People Who Retweeted It

What: Track Twitter users who retweet giveaway posts.

Why: To facilitate the selection of winners from entries based on retweets.

When: Conduct this process each time a giveaway is announced.

1. Schedule the Giveaway

Determine the timing and duration of the giveaway, ensuring clear communication about the entry criteria.

2. Track Retweets

Use a reporting tool with code to monitor retweets. Input the necessary parameters without starting with "mobile."

3. Analyze Results

After the tracking period, review the successful commits from GitHub actions. This includes verifying the processed data including retweeter information.

4. Select Winners

From the compiled list of participants, randomly select five winners for the giveaway.

5. Monitor Regularly

Ensure that tracking occurs continuously, as the system maintains data for only the last hundred retweets. Regular checks help manage entry counts efficiently.
