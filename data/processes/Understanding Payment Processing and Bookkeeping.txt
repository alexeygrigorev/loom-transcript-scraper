Understanding Payment Processing and Bookkeeping

What: Record and declare payments in bookkeeping and manage related documentation.

Why: To ensure accurate financial records and proper expense declaration.

When: When payments are received and need to be documented.

1. Verify Payment Receipt

Check the merchant account (e.g., Revolut) to confirm payment entry.

2. Create Bookkeeping Document

Print the relevant invoice and save it as a PDF.

3. Send Document via Email

Email the saved PDF to the designated bookkeeping address for record-keeping and expense declaration.

4. Verify Document Entry

Check the bookkeeping records after a brief period to confirm that the document has been logged correctly.

5. Withdraw Funds

If applicable, initiate the withdrawal process from the merchant account, following established procedures.

6. Review for Existing Processes

Ensure there are existing process documents related to payment recording and withdrawal. Update or create new documentation as necessary.
