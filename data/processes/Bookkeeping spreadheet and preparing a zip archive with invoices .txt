Bookkeeping Spreadsheet and Preparing a Zip Archive with Invoices

What: Maintaining bookkeeping by filing tax declarations and archiving invoices.

Why: To ensure accurate financial reporting and compliance with tax regulations, specifically declaring all income.

When: At the beginning of each month for the previous month's financial activities.

1. Add Extra Line for the Month

Separate each month in the bookkeeping spreadsheet by adding an extra line. Ensure the entries are sorted by the date the invoices were issued and the date they were paid.

2. Verify Income

Check that all income for the previous month is declared. This includes reviewing payments received in different bank accounts and ensuring they are reflected in the bookkeeping spreadsheet.

3. Collect Invoices

Gather all the invoices issued to clients for the previous month. Confirm that you have both physical and electronic invoices.

4. Create a Zip Archive

Take all the invoices and compress them into a zip folder. Change the name of the zip file to indicate the month it covers.

5. Review for Missing Payments

Cross-check the income listed in the bookkeeping spreadsheet against actual payments received. If any income is missing, investigate and add it to the spreadsheet.

6. Document Payment to Accountant

Record the payment made to the accountant at the beginning of the month. Update any necessary details in the bookkeeping spreadsheet, including referencing the previous month's declaration for consistency.

7. Prepare for Submission

Once all invoices and income are accounted for, finalize the documentation for submission to the accountant. Ensure all entries are complete and accurate.
