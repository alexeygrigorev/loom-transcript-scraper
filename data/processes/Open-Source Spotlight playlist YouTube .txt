Open-Source Spotlight Playlist Management

What: Managing the Open-Source Spotlight playlist by verifying releases and organizing timestamps.

Why: To ensure that only scheduled and released content is available in the playlist and to maintain consistency in timestamp formatting.

When: This process should be executed before adding new content to the playlist and whenever reviewing existing entries.

1. Check for Scheduled Releases

Verify if the items intended for the playlist are scheduled for release. Only include them once they are officially scheduled.

2. Verify Inclusion in Playlist

Confirm that the unlisted items are not publicly accessible through the playlist until their release date.

3. Format Timestamps Correctly

When receiving timestamps, ensure that all entries include leading zeros for a uniform format across the document. Adjust as necessary to maintain consistency.

4. Update Playlist

Once an item is scheduled for release, add it to the playlist immediately. Ensure proper access settings are applied so that it remains unlisted until the scheduled date.
