New way of getting the anchor link for podcast pages

What: Obtain the correct anchor link for podcast episodes.

Why: To ensure the podcast player functions correctly by using the appropriate URL format.

When: When creating or updating a podcast page.

1. Access the Public Anchor Page

Navigate to the public page of the podcast on Anchor (e.g., anchor.fm/dataTalkClub) to find the episode link.

2. Copy the Episode Link

Select the desired episode link from the public page.

3. Paste the Link in the Form

Insert the copied link into the designated field in the submission form. Ensure the format is correct: it should not include parameters past the question mark.

4. Edit the Link If Necessary

If the URL contains a question mark, remove everything after it. This will streamline the link to the intended format required for proper functionality.

5. Update Documentation

Ensure the process document is updated to reflect this method of obtaining anchor links, keeping consistency with other podcast platforms like Apple and Spotify.
