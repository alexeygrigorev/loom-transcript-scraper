Book Cover URL Submission Process

What: Submitting book cover URLs or uploading book cover images.

Why: To ensure that the book cover images are correctly associated with the respective book entries, enhancing visual representation and information accessibility.

When: This process should be followed when adding or updating book entries in the system.

1. Prepare the Book Cover Image

If the book cover URL is not available, obtain the book cover image file. Resize the image as necessary using an image editing program (e.g., XnView).

- For resizing, consider dimensions such as 300x400 pixels.
- After resizing, save the image.

2. Upload the Book Cover

Access the form where the book details are entered and locate the book cover field.

- Upload the resized image file or input the book cover URL.
- If using a URL, make sure it points directly to the image file.

3. Finding Book Cover URLs

For books without a direct cover image option:

- Click the relevant book link and use the 'Inspect' feature in the browser.
- Locate the image in the HTML code; copy the image source (SRC) URL.

4. Use Image URLs from Other Sources

For pocket books and publications:

- Navigate to the website where the book is listed.
- Right-click on the book cover image and select 'Copy Image Address'.
- Paste the URL in the designated field in your form.

5. Check and Submit

Verify that all required fields are completed, including the book cover URL or uploaded image. Submit the form once all information is accurate.
