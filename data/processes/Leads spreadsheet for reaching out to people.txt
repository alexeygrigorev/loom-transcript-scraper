Leads Spreadsheet for Reaching Out to People

What: Utilize a spreadsheet to organize outreach efforts for workshops and events.

Why: To maintain organization and ensure all contacts are managed effectively, facilitating follow-ups and maximizing engagement.

When: Whenever planning outreach for workshops, webinars, or other events.

1. Create a Spreadsheet

Set up a new spreadsheet to track leads. Include columns for names, event types, contact details (like LinkedIn and email), and status of outreach.

2. Add Lead Information

For each person you plan to reach out to, fill in their name, the type of event they are associated with (e.g., workshop), and their contact details. 

3. Send Initial Outreach

Send a message to each lead, letting them know about the opportunity (e.g., a workshop). Include relevant details and a direct link to the event if applicable.

4. Track Responses

Monitor the spreadsheet for responses and update the status for each contact accordingly. This helps in identifying who requires follow-ups.

5. Follow-Up 

If there is no response after a set period, follow up with the leads to ensure they received the initial outreach and to gauge their interest in participating.
