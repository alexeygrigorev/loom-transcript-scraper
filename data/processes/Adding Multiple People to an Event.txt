Adding Multiple People to an Event

What: Adding multiple authors to an event in events.yaml

Why: To allow collaboration by associating more than one author with an event.

When: When creating or editing an event and needing to include multiple authors.

1. Access the events.yaml

Open the events.yaml file where the event records are stored.

2. Edit the Event Record

Find the event you want to edit and click the edit option. 

3. Add Additional Author

In the author field, add the name of the second person alongside the first author.

4. Commit Changes

This process enables the addition of multiple authors to an event efficiently.
