Announcing Winners of Giveaway Campaigns

What: Process for announcing winners of giveaway campaigns on social media.

Why: To inform participants of the results and collect their contact information for prize distribution.

When: After the raffle draw is complete and winners have been selected.

1. Prepare the winners list

Collect the list of winners from the raffle and ensure all details are accurate.

2. Post on social media

Access the social media platform where the giveaway was held. Click on "retweet" and select "quote tweet." Write a congratulatory message to the winners, for example: "Congratulations to the winners of John Locke's book! Please send us your emails in direct messages. Thank you to everyone for participating!"

3. Monitor responses

Check for direct messages from winners. Be attentive to any message requests and ensure no inquiries are missed.

4. Collect email addresses

As winners respond with their emails, gather them in a compiled document or spreadsheet.

5. Send email list

Once you have a collection of 4-5 email addresses, send them to the designated recipient (e.g., Kevin) using the established email chain.
