Make Sure We Add Streams to Appropriate Playlists

What: Organize and update video content in playlists.

Why: Ensure all content types are categorized correctly for better accessibility and viewer engagement.

When: After each event or recording.

1. Identify Content Type

Review the latest videos to determine if they are podcasts or webinars.

2. Move Incorrectly Categorized Content

If any content is miscategorized (e.g., a webinar listed as a podcast), move it to the appropriate playlist.

3. Update Playlists

Add recent content to the correct playlists, confirming that each entry belongs to its respective category.

4. Collect Links from Speakers

After each webinar or podcast, reach out to speakers for any relevant links they want to share and include them in the description.

5. Implement Checkpoints

Ensure the same checkpoints for collecting links are added to all podcast and webinar templates to maintain consistency.

6. Organize YouTube Links

When available, utilize the fixed podcast page as a reference for sharing links with speakers, streamlining the distribution process.
