Remove the Beginning from the Video Stream

What: Editing video to remove unnecessary introductory content.

Why: To enhance viewer engagement by omitting irrelevant portions of the video.

When: After recording the video and before publishing it for public viewing.

1. Access the Video Editor

Open the video editing software and load the video file that needs editing.

2. Locate the Start Point

Play the video to identify the segment where the relevant content begins. Pause just before this point.

3. Split the Video

Select the portion of the video that you want to remove. Use the 'Split' function in the editor to separate the unwanted introduction from the main content.

4. Remove Unwanted Content

Highlight the split portion that is no longer needed (the introduction) and delete it from the timeline.

5. Preview the Edited Video

Click on the 'Preview' button to review the changes and ensure the transition from the cut section to the new start point flows smoothly.

6. Save the Changes

Once satisfied with the edits, click 'Save.' The editing process will take some time to finalize the changes. Check back later to confirm that the beginning has been successfully removed.
