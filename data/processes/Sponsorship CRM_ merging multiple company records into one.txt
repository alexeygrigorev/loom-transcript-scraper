Sponsorship CRM: Merging Multiple Company Records into One

What: Merging duplicate company records in the Sponsorship CRM.

Why: To maintain accurate and streamlined data by consolidating records for the same entity.

When: Perform this process whenever duplicate company records are found in the CRM.

1. Identify Duplicate Records

Locate the company records in the CRM that are duplicates or have incorrect information.

2. Update Record Information

Modify the necessary fields in the primary record, such as changing the company name from the incorrect entry (e.g., Kafka) to the correct one (e.g., Confluent).

3. Consolidate Additional Data

Ensure that any additional information linked to the duplicate records, such as contacts or deals, is added to the primary record.

4. Merge and Delete Duplicates

Find the duplicate record and use the merging function in the CRM. After merging, delete the duplicate entry to avoid clutter.

5. Verify Accuracy

Check that all relevant information has been successfully merged and that the primary record is now complete and accurate.
