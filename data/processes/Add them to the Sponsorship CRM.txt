Add them to the Sponsorship CRM

What: Identify and categorize sponsors for the CRM.

Why: To ensure relevant sponsors are tracked for future engagement and partnership opportunities.

When: This should be done when evaluating potential sponsors for relevance.

1. Review potential sponsors

Assess each sponsor from the website and determine their relevance. Categorize as high, medium, or low relevance.

2. Add sponsors to the CRM

Only add sponsors identified as medium or high relevance, skipping those deemed low relevance. Use existing data to avoid duplication. 

3. Consolidate entries

Check for any sponsors that might overlap (e.g., IBM and IBM Watson) and prevent redundant entries. 

4. Finalize the list

Ensure only relevant sponsors are included before finalizing the CRM update.
