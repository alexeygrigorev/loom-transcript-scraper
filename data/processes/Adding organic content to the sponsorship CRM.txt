Adding Organic Content to the Sponsorship CRM

What: Update the sponsorship CRM to include both sponsored and organic content.

Why: To ensure we capture all relevant content types for potential sponsorship opportunities, including organic content.

When: When identifying content for sponsorship outreach.

1. Modify Content Type

Change the label from "Sponsored Content" to "Content" to encompass both sponsored and organic materials.

2. Add New Entries

For events like Snowflake's conference, input the event details in the CRM, including:
- Name: Snowflake Data Cloud Summit
- Content Type: Conference
- Source: Organic (if using their own newsletter for promotion)
- Relevance: Medium
- Company: Snowflake
- Date: November

3. Identify Key Contacts

Since there are no existing contacts from Snowflake in the CRM, research and add relevant contacts for outreach to discuss potential sponsorship for their events.

4. Clarify Content Selection Criteria

Document the criteria for determining content type and source. Specify that "Organic" is applicable for self-produced content, such as their own newsletter.
