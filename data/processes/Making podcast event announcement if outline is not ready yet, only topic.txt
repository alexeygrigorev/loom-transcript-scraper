Making Podcast Event Announcement If Outline Is Not Ready Yet, Only Topic

What: Create a podcast event announcement without a finalized outline.

Why: To initiate the event planning process and provide a placeholder for details to be added later.

When: When the title is confirmed but the outline is not yet available.

1. Access Event Creation Platform

Go to the event management platform where you can create announcements.

2. Define Event Title

Input the confirmed title of the podcast event.

3. Add Event Details

Since the outline is not ready, focus on key information:
- Choose a placeholder subtitle or leave it to be finalized later.
- Set the event date (e.g., March 11) and time (e.g., 12:00 PM).

4. Update Biographical Information

Use pre-existing biographical details for featured speakers. Confirm if their personal website should be included.

5. Include Placeholder Sections

Add a placeholder for any sections that need to be filled in later, such as the agenda or additional information.

6. Choose an Initial Image

Select a temporary image to represent the event until a finalized image is provided.

7. Save the Announcement

Ensure all details are saved to allow for updates as more information becomes available.
