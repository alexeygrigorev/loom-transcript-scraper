Don't add linebreaks to process docs (and if you really want, we can use pageless setup).

What: Adjust document formatting to avoid line breaks.

Why: To ensure the document appears cohesive and prevents unnecessary breaks that may disrupt readability.

When: Apply this formatting process when preparing documents for presentation or distribution.

1. Access file settings.

Go to the "File" menu in your document editor.

2. Select pageless setup.

Choose the option for "pageless" or "single page" layout to prevent line breaks.

3. Review formatting. 

Ensure images and content are properly aligned and do not create unintended line breaks. 

4. Save changes.

Finalize and save the document in the new format for sharing or printing.
