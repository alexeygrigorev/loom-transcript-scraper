Adding Reminders in Trello

What: Adding reminders to checklist items in Trello cards.

Why: To ensure important tasks and deadlines are not forgotten.

When: When creating new cards for tasks with specific due dates.

1. Create a new Trello card.

Start by selecting the template you want to use for your project.

2. Set a due date for the task.

Determine the due date for the task (e.g., book launch on March 28th).

3. Add reminders to checklist items.

Set reminders for the checklist items:
   - First reminder: One week before the due date (e.g., March 21st).
   - Second reminder: One day before the due date (e.g., March 27th).

4. Assign tasks to team members.

Assign relevant checklist items to yourself or other team members to ensure accountability.

5. Repeat the process for other tasks.

Follow the same steps for additional tasks, such as webinars or podcasts, ensuring each task has appropriate reminders set.
