Accessing Alexey's Calendar and Scheduling Events

What: Checking Alexey's calendar to determine available times for scheduling podcasts.

Why: To ensure that podcasts are scheduled at times when Alexey is available, avoiding overlaps with existing commitments.

When: Before proposing a time for a podcast, ideally on a Monday afternoon.

1. Open Alexey's Calendar

Access the shared calendar where you can view and edit events.

2. Check Recurring Event Availability

Look for the recurring event block on Mondays at 5 p.m. This time is typically reserved for a podcast.

3. Identify Conflicts

Examine the calendar for any conflicting events on the proposed date. If thereâ€™s already an event at the usual time, proceed to the next step.

4. Propose Alternate Times

If the preferred time is blocked, consider rescheduling to Tuesday or another day when there are no conflicts. Avoid scheduling at noon, especially if participants are in different time zones.

5. Confirm the New Time

Once an alternative time is agreed upon, either update the calendar directly or communicate the proposed time for confirmation.

6. Notify Participants

Inform all relevant participants of the scheduled time and ensure they have access to the updated calendar.
