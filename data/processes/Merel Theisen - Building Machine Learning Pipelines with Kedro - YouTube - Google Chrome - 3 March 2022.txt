When: After identifying relevant speakers from events or talks.

1. Identify the Speaker

Locate a notable speaker from relevant events or talks that align with community interests.

2. Research the Speaker

Search for the speaker on LinkedIn to gather their professional background and current engagements.

3. Compose an Outreach Message

Craft a concise and personalized message inviting the speaker to engage with the community.

4. Introduce Yourself

State your name and role, such as “I am the community manager at [Your Community Name].”

5. Reference Their Talk

Mention the specific talk or event that caught your attention to establish relevance.

6. Extend an Invitation
