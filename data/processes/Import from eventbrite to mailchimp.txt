4. Log into Mailchimp

Go to mailchimp.com and log into your account.

5. Import Contacts

Navigate to your audience section, select "Import Contacts," and choose the copy-paste option. Paste the email addresses from the filtered list.

6. Confirm Import Settings

Select the option to subscribe and update existing contacts. Assign relevant tags, such as "event," and proceed to match the fields.

7. Finalize Import

Review and complete the import process. Mailchimp will display how many new contacts were added and any existing contacts updated.
