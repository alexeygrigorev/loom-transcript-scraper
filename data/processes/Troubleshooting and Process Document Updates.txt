Troubleshooting and Process Document Updates

What: Troubleshooting issues related to author not found errors and updating process documents.

Why: To ensure accurate processing of existing profiles and improve documentation clarity for resolving errors.

When: Whenever issues arise with author identification or when updating process documents.

1. Identify the Error

Check logs for author not found errors related to existing profiles. Use data docs to verify if the person exists.

2. Verify Existing Profiles

If the profile already exists but is marked as not processed, determine if the error is due to the profile being hidden or improperly processed.

3. Document the Symptoms

Record observable symptoms, such as the profile existing in logs yet showing as not found and provide context for these errors in the process documentation.

4. Update the Process Document

Revise the process document to include the identified symptoms and error handling steps.

5. Ensure Documents are Pageless

For all process documents, convert them to pageless format by removing page breaks and reformatting as necessary.

6. Add Context to Documentation

Enhance the updated process document by including explanations of why the document is needed and when to use it.

7. Re-run the Processing

After updating the process document, attempt to rerun the processing to resolve the issues identified with author not found errors.
