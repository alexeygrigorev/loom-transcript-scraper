1. Create a Checklist

Add a checklist to the project description. Include links to relevant documents and ensure all necessary items are listed.

2. Add Reminders

Input tasks or reminders for team members or guests. Focus on essential reminders, avoiding unnecessary ones.

3. Create Project Templates

For recurring projects, use the template feature in Trello. Click on the template, select "Create from Template," and fill in the necessary details.

4. Set Up Reminders for Key Dates

Assign reminder dates for important tasks. Adjust the date based on the project timeline (e.g., one week prior to an event).

5. Invite Participants 

Send invitations to project participants (e.g., authors) and schedule meetings as needed. Ensure all participants have access to relevant Trello cards and communicate through designated channels, such as Slack.

6. Organize and Rearrange Tasks

Continuously assess and rearrange tasks in Trello for optimal organization. This may evolve as project needs change.
