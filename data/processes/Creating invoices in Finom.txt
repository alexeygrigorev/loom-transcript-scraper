   - Amount due: e.g., 16,000 
   - Payment terms: Due within 30 days.
   - Specify if VAT is applicable (e.g., in this instance, it's zero for the US).

4. Add notes or terms

Include necessary notes, especially regarding VAT for European clients, if relevant. 

5. Specify invoice date and number

Set the issue date (e.g., today’s date) and assign an invoice number following your organization’s method (typically year and sequence).

6. Preview and save the invoice

Preview the document to ensure all information is correct, then save it with a descriptive name, such as “Invoice Arise AI”.
