Renaming Profile ID on the website

What: Renaming and updating profile IDs and images to ensure consistency across user profiles.

Why: To resolve discrepancies between user profiles and event participant names, which may arise from typos or missing profiles.

When: When a profile name differs from the event participant name, or when creating new profiles.

1. Identify Discrepancies

Check the URL for the user's profile and verify the displayed name against the event details.

2. Update Profile Name

Navigate to the user profile and edit the name to match the event participant name. Ensure both the full name and short name are identical.

3. Check and Update Images

If the associated image is incorrect, rename it and update the image file location in "images/authors."

4. Create New Profile (if necessary)

If a profile does not exist, use the designated form to create a new profile rather than manually creating files.

5. Confirm Changes

After making updates, verify the changes. It may take a few minutes for updates to reflect across the platform.
