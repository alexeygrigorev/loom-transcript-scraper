5. Repeat for All Videos

Continue the editing process for each video file that requires adjustments. The steps remain the same: select, test run, process.

6. Download New Videos from YouTube (if applicable)

7. Manage Uploads

- Before uploading the edited videos, remove the old versions from the playlist.
