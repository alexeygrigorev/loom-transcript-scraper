Newsletter Preparation Process

What: Preparing and distributing the weekly newsletter.

Why: To communicate updates, announcements, and new content to our audience effectively.

When: Weekly, preferably on Wednesday or Thursday, after preparing the necessary materials.

1. Gather Materials

Collect the necessary information for the newsletter, including announcements, updates, and any specific content such as the book of the week and podcast links.

2. Create Podcast Page

On the designated day (typically Friday or Sunday), create or update the podcast page to ensure that the latest episode information is included.

3. Update Newsletter Template

Access the existing newsletter template. Replace outdated links and content with the new podcast episode details and any other relevant updates.

4. Review and Finalize

Before distribution, review the newsletter for accuracy and coherence. Ensure all links and sections are functional and correctly represent the intended updates.

5. Distribute Newsletter

Send out the finalized newsletter to your mailing list at the optimal time for audience engagement, typically immediately following the review.
