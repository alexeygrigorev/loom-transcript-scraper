Creating Subtitles for Workshops, Webinars, and Podcasts

What: Generate titles for content lacking subtitles.

Why: To provide alternative titles for workshops, webinars, and podcasts when original subtitles are unavailable.

When: Whenever a workshop, webinar, or podcast does not have a corresponding subtitle.

1. Copy the content

Select and copy the entire text of the workshop, webinar, or podcast.

2. Use ChatGPT for title suggestions

Navigate to ChatGPT and paste the copied content. Request title suggestions by asking for potential titles for the workshop, webinar, or podcast.

3. Review the suggestions

Evaluate the generated titles, selecting up to 10 options that suit the content.

4. Communicate suggestions

Share the selected titles with the relevant team member, indicating that subtitles were not available, along with the generated options from ChatGPT.

5. Consider account setup

If you do not have a ChatGPT account, create one. The ChatGPT 4.0 version is available under free plans.
