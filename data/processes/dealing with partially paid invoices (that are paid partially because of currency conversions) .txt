Dealing with Partially Paid Invoices Due to Currency Conversions

What: Retroactively edit invoices that were partially paid due to challenges with currency conversions.

Why: To resolve discrepancies in payments and ensure accurate tax reporting.

When: Perform this process whenever an invoice has been partially paid due to currency conversion issues.

1. Review the Invoice

Check the invoice to confirm the amount received and the original amount billed.

2. Adjust the Invoice Amount

Edit the invoice to reflect the amount paid, ensuring it's marked as fully paid. 

3. Download and Send the Invoice

Download the updated invoice in PDF format. Email it to the client, explaining the payment situation and indicating that the amount received was impacted by currency conversion.

4. Prepare for Future Invoices

Inform the client that future invoices will be issued in USD to simplify payments. Calculate and communicate the converted amount prior to invoicing.

5. Update Reports

Ensure the retroactively edited invoice is included in the next financial report, categorizing it as fully paid rather than partially paid. 

6. Communicate with Management

Compose an email to stakeholders explaining the situation and the actions taken to rectify it.
