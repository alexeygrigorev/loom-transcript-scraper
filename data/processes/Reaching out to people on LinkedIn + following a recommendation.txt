Reaching out to people on LinkedIn + following a recommendation

What: Connecting with potential contacts on LinkedIn.

Why: To expand professional network and engage with individuals recommended by others.

When: When a recommendation is received, or when a connection needs to be made.

1. Send a Connection Request

Find the recommended person on LinkedIn and click "Connect." Include a personalized note explaining the context of the invitation.

2. Craft a Personalized Message

In your connection request, mention the mutual connection who recommended them. Provide a brief introduction about yourself and express interest in connecting.

3. Follow Up

If there is no response to the connection request, consider reaching out again strategically, perhaps referencing the original recommendation or shared interests.
