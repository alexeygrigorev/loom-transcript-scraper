Bookkeeping Spreadsheet Crosscheck with Revolut and Finom

What: Crosscheck financial transactions recorded in a spreadsheet with those in Revolut and Finom.

Why: To ensure accuracy and completeness of financial records, essential for reporting and accounting purposes.

When: Perform this process monthly while preparing financial reports.

1. Review Transactions

Access the year and month of interest in the financial transaction history. Identify all incoming and outgoing transactions.

2. Crosscheck with Spreadsheet

For each transaction in the history, compare it with the entries in the spreadsheet. Confirm that all transactions are accurately represented, including expenses and income.

3. Format Corrections

Ensure all amounts are formatted correctly:
   - Replace commas with dots for decimals.
   - Ensure that minus signs are presented properly.
   - Remove extraneous zeros and adjust formatting according to American standards.

4. Update Names and Descriptions

Verify and update names for accuracy. Collect supporting invoices and documents for all transactions, ensuring they reflect what the transactions are for.

5. Validate Invoice Presence

Confirm that for each record, an associated invoice exists. If an invoice is missing, find it and add it to the appropriate folder (e.g., Dropbox).

6. Counting Invoices

Total the number of invoices processed and check that this matches the expected number based on transaction records.

7. Prepare for Submission

Compile all invoices and documents into a zip file for submission, ensuring consistency in formatting and that no invoices from accountants are included.

8. Final Review

Conduct a final review of the spreadsheet and compare it once more with the transaction history in both Revolut and Finom to ensure nothing is overlooked.
