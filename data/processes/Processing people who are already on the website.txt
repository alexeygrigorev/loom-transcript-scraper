Processing People Who Are Already on the Website

What: Manually map existing users' emails to their records in the database.

Why: To ensure accurate mapping of emails to users already present on the website, preventing duplicate entries and maintaining data integrity.

When: When a user is confirmed to be on the website but lacks a corresponding email mapping in the database.

1. Verify User Existence

Check the Data Docs to confirm if the user is already listed on the website to avoid redundancy.

2. Access the Email Mapping

Navigate to the appropriate section in Data Talks Club, accessing the scripts and hashes where stored records are located.

3. Encrypt the Email

Use an encryption tool (e.g., sha1-online.com) to convert the user’s email into a hashed format. Ensure there are no leading or trailing spaces and that all letters are in lowercase.

4. Update Mapping Record

Edit the respective record in the database to include the newly hashed email. Ensure an empty line is added at the end of the record to maintain format.

5. Mark User as Edited

Go to Airtable and mark the user’s status as edited to prevent the system from trying to process them again.

6. Update Additional Information (if needed)

If applicable, check and update any additional user information, such as their Twitter handle, to keep records consistent.

7. Generate Events

Finally, generate events for the newly mapped emails to ensure they can interact with the system correctly.
