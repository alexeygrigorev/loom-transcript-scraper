Creating Calendar Invites for Webinars

What: Sending calendar invites to speakers for webinars.

Why: To confirm the date and ensure speakers have the necessary information for their presentations.

When: After agreeing on a date with the speaker, even if the topic is not yet finalized.

1. Confirm the Date

Ensure the date for the webinar is agreed upon with the speaker. For instance, March 15 can be established as the date for the webinar.

2. Access Calendar Invite Options

Go to your calendar application and select the option to create a new event. Make sure to explore additional settings by clicking “More options” if needed.

3. Fill in Event Details

Input the essential information:
- Add the date and time for the webinar.
- Include any relevant content for the invite, such as a reminder for the speaker about the webinar format (e.g., mention that this invite is for a webinar).

4. Send the Invite

Input the speaker’s email address, review all details, and send the calendar invite to formally secure the date on their calendar. 

5. Follow Up if Necessary

If the topic or outline is not yet confirmed, it’s acceptable to send the invite to block the date while awaiting the final details from the speaker.
