Airtable Sponsorship CRM Database

What: Track sponsored content and manage potential sponsors using an Airtable CRM.

Why: To identify and categorize potential sponsors for community activities and maintain communication status with them.

When: This process should be followed whenever new sponsored content is discovered or when engaging with potential sponsors.

1. Identify Sponsored Content

Regularly search online platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and newsletters for sponsored content. Document the details, including links to the content.

2. Capture Company Information

Create a record for each company associated with the sponsored content in the CRM. If a company does not exist in the database, add it.

3. Update Company Status

Assign a status to each company based on the level of contact:
   - Prospect: No contact made yet.
   - Contacted: Reached out but no response.
   - Established Contact: Received a reply and engaged in discussions.
   - Client: Company has agreed to sponsor.
   - Past Client: Previously sponsored but no longer active.
   - Lost Declined: No response or explicit decline from the company.

4. Populate Contact Details

For each company, gather and enter information about relevant contacts. Include names, emails, and any pertinent details.

5. Record Deals

Document any sponsored activities or agreements under the 'Deals' section in the CRM. Include details such as type (e.g., workshop), associated company, contact person, and execution date.

6. Regularly Update Records

Continuously monitor and update the status of companies and contacts, noting new sponsorship opportunities and any changes in communication status.

7. Document Processes

Create a clear overview of how to add data to the different tables within the CRM, including sponsored content, contacts, and deals.
