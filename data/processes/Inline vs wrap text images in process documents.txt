Inline vs Wrap Text Images in Process Documents

What: Adjusting image placement in process documents.

Why: To ensure images are easily movable and integrated with text, avoiding disruption in layout.

When: When creating new process documents or updating existing ones.

1. Use Inline Image Mode

Make sure all new images are inserted in inline mode. This integrates the image with the text flow, enabling easier editing and movement within the document.

2. Avoid Wrap Text Mode

Do not use wrap text mode for images. It creates separation between the image and text, leading to layout issues and difficulty in manipulating the image position.
