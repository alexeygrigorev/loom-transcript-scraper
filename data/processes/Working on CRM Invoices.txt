Working on CRM Invoices

What: Manage and track invoices within the CRM system.

Why: To ensure timely follow-up on payments and maintain organized records of invoices, reducing confusion and oversight.

When: When invoices are issued, updated, or need to be tracked for payment status.

1. Create a Table for Invoices

Set up a dedicated table in the CRM for tracking invoices. Each entry should include:
- Invoice number
- Deal name and installment details
- Date sent (date the invoice was emailed)
- Due date (one month after the invoice date)
- Payment status (e.g., created, sent, paid)
- Link to the associated deal in the CRM

2. Input Invoice Details

For each invoice:
- Enter the invoice number.
- Include a note describing the invoice (if necessary).
- Specify the date sent and due date.
- Update the status based on the current state of the invoice.
- Link the invoice to the relevant deal record.

3. Handle Payment Tracking

After an invoice is paid:
- Update the payment status to reflect that it's been paid.
- Record the actual date paid for tracking purposes.

4. Duplicate Invoices as Needed

When multiple installments are required for a deal:
- Create duplicate entries for each installment.
- Update installment details accordingly.

5. Review and Update Records Regularly

Consistently check all invoices and deals:
- Ensure the table is filled out completely, focusing on records from the current year.
- Adjust any necessary details or statuses as required.
