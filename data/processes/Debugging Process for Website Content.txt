Debugging Process for Website Content

What: Troubleshooting issues related to adding content (events, podcasts, books) to the website.

Why: To identify and resolve errors that prevent successful content addition, ensuring website functionality and user experience.

When: When content fails to process, indicated by logs showing "processed zero" or error messages.

1. Identify the Failure

Check logs to see where the content addition failed. Look for indications of processed items (people, books, podcasts, events).

2. Review the Error Details

Examine the error message; for example, "key error email." Understand which area (events, podcasts, etc.) is causing the issue.

3. Address Specific Errors

Navigate to the area causing the issue (e.g., events) and identify any records with missing or incorrect data (such as an empty email field).

4. Correct or Delete Problematic Entries

Delete any entries causing errors. For example, if an email field is empty, remove that entry to prevent processing failure.

5. Update Related Content

If content is dependent on previous successful processing (like a "book of the week"), make the necessary adjustments, such as changing statuses from "done" to "to do."

6. Re-execute the Process

Run the workflow again after making the necessary changes. Monitor the logs to confirm successful processing of the updated entries.

7. Document the Debugging Process

Create a detailed document outlining the debugging steps. Include links to previous instructional materials (like how to add people) for reference and future troubleshooting.

8. Monitor for Further Issues

If new errors arise, note them and update the debugging document accordingly for improved future reference.
