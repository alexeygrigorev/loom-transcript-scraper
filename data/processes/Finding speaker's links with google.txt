Finding Speaker's Links with Google

What: Locating online profiles for speakers, primarily on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Why: To streamline the process of connecting with guests and ensuring accurate representation in communications and on podcast pages.

When: Conduct this process when preparing for guest interviews or events requiring speaker profiles.

1. Google Search for Speaker Profiles

Type the speaker's name into Google to find their LinkedIn or Twitter accounts. Results may vary; not every speaker will have a digital footprint.

2. Clone the Template for Links

Use the existing template to document retrieved links. Modify the template to specify the profiles found.

3. Verify and Update Profiles

If profiles are located, confirm their accuracy. Communicate with the speaker to verify existing links and request any missing profiles.

4. Send Modified Template

Integrate the found profiles into official correspondence, specifying that links have been gathered and request further information if needed.

5. Prepare Additional Contact Details 

If previous contact information is available, utilize it effectively without redundancy. Ensure all links are accurate before reaching out to speakers.
