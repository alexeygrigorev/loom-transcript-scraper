Open-Source Spotlight Airtable Database

What: Organize and transfer data related to open source projects into a new Airtable database.

Why: To maintain an efficient record of open source projects, enabling better tracking and follow-up with project contacts.

When: When new open source projects are identified, or as a regular update to ensure contact information and project statuses are current.

1. Create a new Airtable table

Set up an "Open Source Spotlight" table in Airtable, similar to existing database structures.

2. Identify open source projects to transfer

Review existing records and select open source projects that have not yet been recorded.

3. Gather project details

For each project, find relevant details such as the project name, GitHub URL, and contact person.

4. Input data into the new table

Enter the gathered project details into the new Airtable table, including:
- Project name
- GitHub URL
- Status (e.g., New, In Progress, Done)
- Last contact date

5. Establish a status system

Define the status system for project tracking:
- New: Project identified but not yet contacted.
- In Progress: Contact has been made, awaiting a response.
- Done: Project has been recorded and completed.

6. Transfer existing information

Move the relevant project information from the old table to the new one, ensuring to delete records from the old table after transferring.

7. Utilize Kanban view for status tracking

Implement a Kanban view in Airtable to visualize project statuses, enabling easy updates as projects move through different stages.

8. Follow up with contacts

Regularly review the list of contacts for projects marked as "In Progress" or "New" and follow up as needed to engage them.
