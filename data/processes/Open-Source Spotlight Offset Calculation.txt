Open-Source Spotlight Offset Calculation

What: Calculate time offsets for video recording timestamps.

Why: To accurately edit video segments based on the correct start time of meetings and recordings.

When: Whenever a recording is released that requires timestamp adjustments.

1. Gather Meeting and Recording Start Times

Contact support to obtain the official start times for the meeting and the recording.

2. Format Timestamps

In the provided spreadsheet, input the meeting start timestamp in the correct format (hh:mm:ss), ensuring it aligns with the designated cells for calculations.

3. Input Original Timestamps

Record original timestamps for significant moments in the video within the spreadsheet.

4. Apply the Offset Formula

Use the formula: `=B2 - $A$1` in the respective cells to calculate the adjusted start times. The dollar signs ensure cell references remain constant when the formula is copied down.

5. Review Adjusted Timestamps

Verify that the calculated timestamps make sense in the context of the recording duration and ensure there are no discrepancies.

6. Use Timestamps for Video Editing

Utilize the adjusted timestamps to inform the video editing process, ensuring all relevant segments align with the intended content. 

7. Document the Process

Keep a record of these adjustments and steps for future reference and consistency in future recordings.
