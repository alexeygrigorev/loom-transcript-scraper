Removing Small Talk in Event Introductions

What: Remove unnecessary small talk before event introductions.

Why: To ensure the audience receives relevant content immediately and avoids distractions.

When: Prior to the start of any event, typically five minutes before the scheduled time.

1. Identify the Start of the Event

Look for the moment when the host begins the formal introduction, usually marked by phrases like "Hi everyone, welcome to our event" or "This event is brought to you by..."

2. Cut Small Talk

Remove all dialogue prior to the identified start of the event. Confirm with the host if there is any uncertainty.

3. Exercise Judgment

In cases where the host may not share the screen or starts differently, use your judgment to find when the actual event begins, utilizing the context of the discussion.

4. Document Procedures

Create and maintain a document outlining criteria for determining the start of events and identifying small talk. This will serve as a reference for future events.

5. Review Edited Events

For events already edited, verify that the content flows properly and contains no unnecessary conversations.
