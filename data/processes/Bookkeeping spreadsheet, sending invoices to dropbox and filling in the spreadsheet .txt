Bookkeeping: Sending Invoices to Dropbox and Filling in the Spreadsheet

What: Recording and filing expenses in a spreadsheet and Dropbox by sending invoices via email.

Why: Accurate tracking of business expenses is essential for financial management and record-keeping.

When: Immediately after an expense is incurred and payment is made.

1. Pay the Invoice

Process the invoice payment through the chosen service (e.g., Uber Suggest, MailChimp) and obtain the payment confirmation.

2. Save the Invoice as a PDF

Open the payment confirmation email and print it as a PDF. Ensure that the file is named appropriately, ideally following the format of "YYYY-MM-DD - service".

3. Send PDF to Dropbox

Use a designated email channel (e.g., an automated service that uploads attachments directly to Dropbox) to send the PDF invoice. Provide a brief subject line or topic to help categorize it, using the same naming convention established earlier.

4. Update the Spreadsheet

Open the bookkeeping spreadsheet. 
- Enter the date of the invoice.
- List the service provider (e.g., Uber Suggest).
- Include details of the expense:
  - Amount (use a negative value for expenses).
  - If applicable, adjust for currency conversion.
- Save the changes.

5. Repeat for Future Invoices

For recurring invoices (e.g., MailChimp), follow the same process upon receiving the billing notification. Regularly check and update the spreadsheet as new invoices are processed to maintain accurate records.
