Sending Invoices with USD from Google Drive

What: Sending invoices for services rendered in USD format using Google Drive and Dropbox.

Why: To comply with client requirements for invoicing in USD, as some clients, like Nvidia, do not accept invoices in Euros.

When: Invoices should be sent upon completion of the service or as requested by the client. 

1. Access Google Drive

Open Google Drive and locate the pre-prepared invoice to be sent. Ensure it is properly formatted and ready for submission.

2. Download the Invoice

Download the invoice in PDF format from Google Drive.

3. Save to Dropbox

Upload the downloaded invoice to the designated folder in Dropbox under "paperwork/income invoices."

4. Ensure Compliance with Client Requirements

Check for any client-specific requests, such as including a purchase order (PO) number in the invoice. Add this information to the invoice if necessary.

5. Prepare for Sending

Open your email client and compose a new email to the client. Include any required CC recipients.

6. Schedule or Send Invoice

Set the email to send immediately or schedule it for the date requested by the client.

7. Confirm Submission

After sending, ensure that the invoice is properly recorded in Dropbox and any relevant systems for tracking purposes.
