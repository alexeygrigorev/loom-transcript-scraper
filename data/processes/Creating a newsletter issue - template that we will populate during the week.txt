Creating a Newsletter Issue - Template That We Will Populate During the Week

What: Creation of a newsletter issue template from existing drafts for weekly updates.

Why: To streamline the process of preparing and populating the newsletter with relevant content on a weekly basis.

When: This process should be executed at the start of each week.

1. Duplicate Existing Draft

Access the existing draft of the newsletter. Duplicate it to create a new template for the upcoming week.

2. Set the Date

Change the date on the new template to reflect the upcoming week's date.

3. Assess Upcoming Events

Check the calendar for any events planned for the following week. Populate the "events" section of the template with this information. 

4. Update Podcast Information

Include any latest podcast releases or information available. If the latest podcast is not yet released, leave a placeholder and update later.

5. Modify the "Book of the Week"

Edit the "Book of the Week" section as necessary. This should be updated weekly to reflect new recommendations or changes.

6. Save Changes

Ensure that all modifications are saved in the template. Avoid sending out the incomplete newsletter at this stage.

7. Weekly Population

Throughout the week, return to the template to add and edit content as new information becomes available, ensuring the newsletter is comprehensive and up-to-date.
