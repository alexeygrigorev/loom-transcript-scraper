What: Managing ticket sales status for events on Eventbrite.

Why: To ensure potential attendees can register for events without encountering the "sales ended" issue.

When: Every time an event is published on Eventbrite.

2. Check Ticket Sales Status

Click on the event and go to the "Tickets" section. Verify the sales status, ensuring it reflects "Sales Ended" appropriately.

3. Update Sales End Date
