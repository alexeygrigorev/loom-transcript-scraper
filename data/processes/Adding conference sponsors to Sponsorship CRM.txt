What: Adding sponsors from conferences to the Sponsorship CRM.

Why: To identify potential sponsors in our community who are already engaged in sponsoring conferences, enhancing our sponsorship opportunities.

3. Duplicate Records for Additional Sponsors

For sponsors that might have similarities in data entries:
