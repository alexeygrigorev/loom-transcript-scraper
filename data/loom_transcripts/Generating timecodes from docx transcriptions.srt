1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,120
I want to show you how to generate generate time

2
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:11,240
codes from transcripts.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,730
So here I'm

4
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:17,900
hearing the transcript.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,170
So this is the transcript.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,690
So now I don't want it

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,350
to have a 10, my download folder.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,100
So open it. Um,

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,170
yeah. Now I need to rename it. So I need to know what kind

10
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:52,450
of name I should give it. So go to our schedule

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,980
document, and then, yeah,

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,340
please. Don't forget to add spaces here.

13
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,890
So this is the podcast

14
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,440
for which we add. And then what I do is,

15
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,160
so there's a season seven episode, six

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,910
episode six is four months,

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,490
and then the name is Amy tests. So this is the name of

18
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:34,680
this document. And then I go to this transcript

19
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,150
details. I already edit.

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,190
So I'm sorry, I'm in the code now.

21
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,160
So go to docs folder,

22
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,490
and here I click add file and upload

23
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:56,200
the file. Then I

24
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,440
go to the final edge of the loaded. It should be in this format.

25
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,920
So click open, and then I can

26
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:10,720
change this. So now the file is uploaded and

27
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,630
no, all this,

28
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,670
uh, refresh it. So now I need to go to auctions and

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,310
connections. I see that now they have to think,

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,980
I just edit this, add files,

31
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:33,110
the upload. So it is doing something.

32
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,700
And so you see now it's green and what happened

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,740
is now you come back to tasks and now you

34
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:47,120
go to task and now this file appeared there.

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,540
So it was automatically added. So what happens is when

36
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,210
you add a file to this folder,

37
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,370
to the equivalents, when you upload this,

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,660
there an action that is automatically ticket that analyzes

39
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:07,090
this document document,

40
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,810
and then it clicks. So then you go to this transcript,

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,820
you copied this, and then you called and

42
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:19,810
then YouTube.

43
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,140
Yes.

44
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,570
Yeah.

45
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,710
This is a list of topics that we talked about.

46
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,160
Then I save now there's

47
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,480
time coats

48
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,940
all the time quotes are here, groups.

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,090
Yeah. So they are here. Now I know that you also

50
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,340
already scheduled podcast episodes.

51
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,350
So because that time available when you were killing

52
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,490
them, and now we can add the time quotes,

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,840
let me go two episodes.

54
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,170
And this one I'll give you

55
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:39,180
details and then edit.

56
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,670
Hmm. Yeah.

57
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,100
That's an edge. And

58
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:54,100
then the list of things from here.

59
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,280
Yeah. Usually it is finding somebody online because

60
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:22,770
we talked about that every episode,

61
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:37,470
because that's the list that we put now to anchor and

62
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:42,120
to use control sheets. If I just do control

63
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:45,570
V yeah.

64
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,550
It doesn't do any work. Yeah.

65
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,730
Anyways. Yeah. I also noticed that the

66
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,790
<v 1>Links placed it and not right.

67
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,270
So you see that this thinks here,

68
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,270
so I think you copied it from,

69
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,420
from here because there are these dots.

70
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,930
You actually need to copy this from the description when you click.

71
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,690
So the links are all there.

72
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,680
Um, yeah. So let me do this right now.

73
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:30,140
Let me fix it. So I copied and

74
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,990
cool and replace it.

75
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,190
And now I need to this next.

76
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,340
Yeah, I think it's fine.

77
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,110
So clickable Davis and

78
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,980
tiny too, to make sure it's still scheduled.

79
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,430
It's scheduled for 7:00 PM.

80
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,740
So, so yeah, this is how you get 10 codes.

81
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,080
So you use this transcript details. You put this upload a file to topics

82
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,840
and then to docs, and then it automatically appears in this folder

83
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:17,350
after.
