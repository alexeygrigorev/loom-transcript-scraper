1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Event, this one book of the week event is coming soon.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,810
So this one, this one.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,220
So it's actually tomorrow. So what they want to do now is I want

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:15,870
to ask the author to

5
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:19,200
share this thing with, um, their audience.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,470
So like it doesn't have to be through LinkedIn.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,950
Um, they also have Peter,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,640
so I will write to him.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,570
I can

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,520
and you can see here for verse this

11
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:47,700
one.

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,520
Can I please share that in a more tomorrow?

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,710
Yeah. So, because statement starts tomorrow,

14
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,080
maybe it's actually better to do tomorrow or today.

15
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:12,790
It doesn't say yeah,

16
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,640
actually, because it's the day Sunday, maybe,

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,170
Uh, it was today, some days less activity.

18
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,400
So let me work. Can you please share the link to this page with

19
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:52,600
your folders and connections? The one who went through this one?

20
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,600
Okay. Yeah. We need to work on this template.

21
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,280
Uh, no, maybe

22
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:06,580
it's a good idea to include some examples. I don't have these examples right

23
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,730
now, but yeah, I can work on the text.

24
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,920
What they did here is we need to ask the speaker and the book

25
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:18,730
author in this case to tell their network,

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,820
uh, LinkedIn,

27
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,510
um, and they daily also folders yet.

28
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,600
It also implies that they might share this one.

29
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,280
Uh, so I asked them to share

30
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:39,370
this link. It's just not good

31
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,610
that they noticed this, that it should be this one.

32
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,970
So,

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,670
<v 1>Yeah.

34
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,270
Yeah. So this is how I do this. I asked to do them to

35
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,780
spread the awareness of office spent by.
