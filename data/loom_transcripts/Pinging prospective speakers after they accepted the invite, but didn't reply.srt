00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,850
Yeah, I think so this guy,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,880
Frederick, he accepted my connection request.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,980
So this was like,

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:15,180
we sent the connection to the question like accepted, but he didn't say anything.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,650
So that's why I kind of follow up.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,350
And this is the format I used.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,930
So maybe at somewhere in your templates,

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,250
if you see that somebody accepted the invite,

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,170
but didn't apply anything so you can use,

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,870
um, this way. No,

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,560
for.
