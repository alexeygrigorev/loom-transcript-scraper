1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,870
<v 1>Um, Hey, it seems like it's getting a bit crowded here,

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,200
so I just want to show you how we can remove the leads.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,130
Cost.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,290
Thank you. Okay. People hold declined.

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,600
So, oops. So I think you've got a point,

6
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:30,300
right? So if you want to, who's supposed to, can just delete Either

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,310
closed or I had a client,

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,440
So

9
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,790
Yeah,

10
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,720
Actually this one

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,010
And this one who

12
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,530
See, or maybe we can just for time being,

13
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,010
Um, maybe let's start with Five.

14
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,220
All right. So just Hi Tom.

15
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,860
Then we can come back to them after sometime.

16
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,910
I don't know what should be there all for hiding them.

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,610
What should be the process? We'll

18
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:43,330
figure this out.
