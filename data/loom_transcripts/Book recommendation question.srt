00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,940
Hello. So what I did, I added this line here in the template.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,980
Are there any books or other resources that you can recommend to the listeners?

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,300
So, uh, can you please, uh, go,

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,780
um, take this and put it to all the podcast documents

5
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:20,460
that we have in the pipeline? So,

6
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:24,060
for example, let's take this one. I think she actually canceled,

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,260
right? Did she? So maybe I'll come.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,500
So what, so we, we don't,

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,220
uh, it here. So maybe also create a process

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,620
document or included in one of the protest documents,

11
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:43,100
uh, that if I guest cancels,

12
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:46,540
then we move it here. Okay.

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,140
So for Yulia, I think Yulia also canceled,

14
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:53,860
right? Did she But according to the date,

15
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:56,020
Yeah, she did. Um,

16
00:00:56,021 --> 00:01:00,620
yeah, please go through all these documents and then if somebody canceled we just,

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,340
um, move it from there.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,980
And then, uh, so for sad, I think we can just edit

19
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:12,500
it here and then you can do the same thing for all the other,

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,100
um, podcast documents. And yeah,

21
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:20,540
maybe in the future we will come up with a bunch of,

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,420
um, is the template with a bunch of common questions

23
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:29,940
for all the podcasts. And I will include them here and I will ask

24
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:34,220
you to, um, update on the existing ones,

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,100
um, with this. Okay.

26
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:39,860
Maybe to make it a bit easier, um,

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,660
I think for this year we already booked almost all the podcasts.

28
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,860
Uh, update the name. Okay.

29
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,060
Yeah, that's it. Uh, that's all I wanted to show.
