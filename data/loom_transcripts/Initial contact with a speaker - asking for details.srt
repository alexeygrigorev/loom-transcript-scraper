1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,930
I also wanted to show you a conversation with,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,050
uh, that I've had with one of the speakers.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,230
So she reached out to me saying that she wants to give a talk

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,010
and then we get some, the topic trying

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:17,550
to scroll

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,490
Australian works. So we agreed to that topic.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,990
And then, yeah, I told her that we have two types of events and,

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,910
uh, we decided to go with webinars and then I

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,700
proposed the date to start saying that,

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,180
uh, yeah, so we have this lot.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,880
And, uh, I,

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,550
well, after that, I said that we need to talk offline.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,870
So basically all the information that we need for a publishing event.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,090
So I told you all that, and you will also need to do that.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,310
So will, you will need to ask the speakers to do

16
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,920
provide this information. And this is something you will be there,

17
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:11,210
put in the form. And I ask your email because she was reaching to

18
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:16,010
me through slack. Um, but I think sometimes

19
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:19,280
it makes email makes more sense. Um,

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,850
and then, yeah, we agree on day and

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,910
yeah, so now she sent it and then,

22
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,440
um, so she sent him a title and then I propose to change the

23
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:37,070
title and I propose to change a little debut a little bit.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,770
So the view was I am,

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,420
and then I asked her to speak about you're in the third form,

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,140
a person, you know,

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,060
meaning good place I have with sheet.

28
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,750
And also give me your full name and your email.

29
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:00,230
She still hasn't sent me email. And then,

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,950
yeah. So there's other things I asked her to do.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,640
So she gave that, um,

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,070
and I saw that one of the things was missing so that we also

33
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,470
need a subtitle. So if you see this as an event,

34
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,960
page of maybe testing and,

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,950
uh, this, that at all, we got some title and then outline of payments.

36
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:28,310
So she didn't provide a subtitle. So I asked her to give that,

37
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,200
and then wait, you will have a form like,

38
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,560
or people or books that you will need to put,

39
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,970
to use to put all this information there in the form,

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,980
or actually, no, you will not need to put this in the form because

41
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:48,080
you will need to put this in, right? Yeah,

42
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:51,560
that's right. So you will need to put this to Eventbrite and,

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,540
uh, we'll use seven brands or for these things.

44
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,200
And then after this announced to know Evan bread,

45
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,830
then you will need to put this in the form, but I will now

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,190
make a separate video about that. So yeah.
