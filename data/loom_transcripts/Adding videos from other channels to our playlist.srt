1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,290
I just realized we might not have instructions about adding

2
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:08,250
videos not from our channel to the playlist.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,270
So if this is a video we want to add to the playlist,

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,934
to the Data Engineering Zoom Cam playlist, but it's not our channel.

5
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,994
And you probably know how to do this, but just for the sake of

6
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:25,134
completeness and we also can create a process document for that.

7
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:30,554
I want to show you how to do this. We click save here and

8
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:35,126
then we select which playlist we want to save and then it's

9
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:39,806
date engineer. And then like as I asked you in

10
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:43,366
telegram we also need to put it in the right location so then we

11
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,826
you know how to do this we should already have process document for that

12
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:49,698
you would need to. Yeah,

13
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:54,198
so that's how you add a video from different channels to our playlist.
