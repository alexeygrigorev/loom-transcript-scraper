00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,570
Okay. I think I know what's going on. So when I ,

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,860
um, and do it, it's like spaces

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:15,630
here. See these, this now when

4
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:18,420
I checked it and now you see the different,

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,220
and now it is actually within limits and we still have two characters.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,520
So I don't know why Google docs is doing this,

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,640
but yeah, you can be more like bomb to be,

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,250
or there's like this.
