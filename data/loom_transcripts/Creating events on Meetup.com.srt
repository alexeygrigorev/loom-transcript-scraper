00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,460
Okay. The integration with mail meetup shows up here no

2
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:10,260
longer works. It means that now I have to manually create events meetup

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,480
as well. It's very unfortunate,

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,230
but this is what I do for that. So it takes to create any

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,710
event and then let's meet what I just created.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,300
So this is the event I just created. And then come on board.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,740
This is the name, the name,

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,590
the title. And then let's look at date and time.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,350
So it's Tuesday, February 8:00 PM,

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,400
Tuesday 7:00 PM.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,230
GMT plus one iteration is one

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,320
or then upload the photo.

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,430
So they're just over the same picture we used for loosely.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,310
Um, truly for a lack of Tokyo at

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,230
work, this is kind of too tight

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,230
on that. It's fine. And then now we need to put a description.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,640
I am just going to compete this

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,030
format a little bit here.

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,580
So, um,

20
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,700
um, bullet point list. So I need to do this and it's

21
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:39,600
this elaborate X here

22
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,470
and luck and thank you

23
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,540
for your out. Fortunately,

24
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,730
I was f*** my data

25
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:57,240
dogs, slack each day,

26
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,830
and then this is an Atlanta event. Um,

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,280
and it'll link to our YouTube channel and then Muslim.

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,570
Yeah, I think that's all when you do so title

29
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,460
time, division,

30
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,950
image, and description,

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,740
and then I'd select everything here.

32
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,600
Then, then this is online event. So YouTube channels here and then

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,470
publish.

34
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,860
Okay. And now it asks to announce it.

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,570
I announced cool.

36
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,560
But so unfortunately there is a lot,

37
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,070
there is not more when you work them before because integration,

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,390
Zapier stopped working. I hope they will fix it at some point,

39
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,240
but, uh, this is what it is.
