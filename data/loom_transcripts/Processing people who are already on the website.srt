1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,490
Okay, so the garden, the area posted.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,260
So I see that you added Moran to the table.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,340
So just wanted to tell you that if we already have somebody or somebody

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,670
on the website, you do not need to add them to be stable.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,720
So you can quickly check this. If you go to data docs,

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,430
Klopp to people, and here you can find,

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,030
uh, um, Moran.

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:30,090
Yes. So he's here, he's already on the website and in DTO,

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,220
right? That this is the reason would have,

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,190
uh, and narrow in there.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,870
So we have from Moran here and now I will show you what to

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:44,520
do in case. Now we have a user already a person

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,680
on the website. Um,

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,310
yeah. So we will need to go to data talks club,

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,040
uh, YouTube, this one, and Dan

16
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:01,350
would go to scripts and data and

17
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,110
hashes. So here we store people.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,300
Um, so this is a sort of encrypted email and this is their

19
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,120
ID. So ID is the thing we have here,

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,950
like, uh, after slash so people slash this is the idea of a Moran

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,210
and here we have a sort of a mapping from,

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,930
um, email to a person.

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,590
Right. And do you see that Moran is not here?

24
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,430
And it usually what happens when you feel a forum and to execute there

25
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:37,720
is there is an Euro here to go from an email to person,

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,700
right. Um, because this thing is relatively,

27
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,270
like I created it recently, um,

28
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,790
long ago before, long before I had Moran.

29
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,350
Hm. Yeah. So here what he needs to do to add him manually.

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,320
So first of all, you do not need to create this record.

31
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:03,940
So we at least have somebody, you do not need to create a record

32
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,220
in, uh, in this database, in the form.

33
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,460
Um, but what we need, need to do is soon we need to have

34
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:15,910
this mapping between the email and the person.

35
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,380
So click edit here. And,

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,690
um, now I need to have this encryption,

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,880
right? So I need to go from this email to

38
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,100
this hash. And for that, um,

39
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,710
there is a website that I can use, um,

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,760
this one, Shaw one minus online.com.

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,530
And I put the email here that I want to encrypt.

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,040
And it's important to hear that there are no spaces at the beginning and

43
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,570
at the end, and it's only lowercase letters.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,360
So let's say if email looked like this,

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,580
and then let's say a space here, so we need to remove a space

46
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:00,550
here and we need, um,

47
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,800
make it lowercase, right? Although that there must be lower case and

48
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,200
then important that it's,

49
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,680
Shajuan here, it's by default and then I could cash.

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,040
And this is the result. So I take this series out and

51
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,250
I put it here at the end, uh,

52
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,730
this, and then I need to have the ID of this person.

53
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,940
And they  everything like between people slash something and then HTML.

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,190
So they ID is distinct. So I click here and

55
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:40,210
then it's important to add another line. So always there should be an empty

56
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,540
line at the end. So this is what I edit,

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,710
edit this line. And then I made sure that there is any way on

58
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,800
the one, um, which means ya,

59
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,380
I'm just key tender here.

60
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,170
And then yeah, just,

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,330
uh, could, can we change this?

62
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,710
And, uh, what the next thing I need to do is because you edit

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,290
already Moran. So I will go to air table and

64
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:16,420
I will mark him as edit ah,

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,810
people and yeah,

66
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,290
Moran. I am mark him as,

67
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,640
um, Don and

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,190
yeah, by the way, since we have three, three here,

69
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:35,090
and we didn't add Twitter before, so I can also show you how to

70
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:35,690
editor.

71
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,710
So for that, we need to go to the root here,

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,410
narrow to three separate repository, then people,

73
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,130
and here we look for,

74
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,910
um, Mariah. Yeah. He was him.

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,450
Then we click edit and we just tried

76
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,510
to be thorough. And then this is his Twitter handle.

77
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,950
And yeah. And just say,

78
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,700
let me check if we have the same bio,

79
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,750
uh, I think this is the same buyer,

80
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,880
right? Yeah. It is the same buyer.

81
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,410
So I just click commit changes.

82
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,740
Yeah. Here we mark him as edit already.

83
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,200
So I changed the status. So this way,

84
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,950
this clip to have, will not try to process this record.

85
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,860
So it will only process records that we need to add.

86
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,500
And there is nothing because every, everything is processed.

87
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,010
Um, so yeah,

88
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,890
probably. Yeah. So we have this event with Ryan.

89
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,480
This is email. And now, because we edit this mapping manually,

90
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,120
now it will be able to see that for this email.

91
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,140
So it will apply the same thing to the sea mail.

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,870
And it will find the record for this email,

93
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,710
but this is the ID and it will just create an event.

94
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:16,550
So let me now go to actions and three

95
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,630
gear generate all,

96
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,920
and now in three minutes, each should hopefully work fine.

97
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,380
Okay. Let's uh, this is what I wanted to show you,

98
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,220
how, how you add emails to this list if people

99
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:39,060
are already, uh, on our website now.

100
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,570
So by.
