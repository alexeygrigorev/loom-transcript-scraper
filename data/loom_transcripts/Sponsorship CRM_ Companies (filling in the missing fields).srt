1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,800
Also wanted to explain what this company's is.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,160
I think I did talk about this last time.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,560
So when we add companies, you see that this is empty,

4
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:12,320
right? So these are the companies that we just added.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,960
So we need to add status. So if we don't have status for them,

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,720
they become prospects. So just put,

7
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,800
start those prospects actually Jet Brains.

8
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:24,120
I think we add, we have Jet brains already,

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,040
so let me quickly check if we have Jet.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,280
Yeah, so lemme see this one.

11
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:36,600
Jet Brains. Um,

12
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,160
yeah, I'll see how to, to merge them later.

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,920
Um, yeah, but for now,

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,680
so what we can do apart from the brains,

15
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:48,040
I think I can just remove them because they don't have any content assigned

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,720
to them. I can just remove them.

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,110
Uh, yeah.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,510
So you can, um, for them actually for weights and biases,

19
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:04,990
we already have it's established content contact.

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,630
For the rest it is,

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,830
um, status is,

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,470
uh, prospect, right?

23
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:16,830
So we haven't contacted them. And then for text,

24
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,550
you probably, I don't know,

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,750
I don't know how much you can put this here for contacts,

26
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,950
probably not much too. But what you can put here is the relevancy based

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,830
on, based on the relevancy of the content,

28
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,350
right? So you can just put here the relevance of the company and then,

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,550
uh, fill in this information. So for example,

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,990
in the website on that I just showed you,

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,750
we have the information about the website. Maybe you can have,

32
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,830
you can find their LinkedIn account too,

33
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,110
Twitter account too, Uh, GI up,

34
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,190
not important, just to have a way to find them quickly if,

35
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:54,670
uh, we want to find people who work there.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,950
So have enough website and LinkedIn is useful.

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,030
Um, and then for contacts, uh,

38
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:03,870
we will cover that later. Hmm.

39
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,350
Okay. Yeah, I think that's,

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,690
uh, that's all. Yeah,

41
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:15,830
for text. Um, uh,

42
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,910
I'm still thinking how useful texts are. Maybe we'll just,

43
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,190
uh, drop them later.
