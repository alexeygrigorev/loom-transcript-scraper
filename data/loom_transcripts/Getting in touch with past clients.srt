1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,430
So I wanted to show you how I follow up with past clients.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,470
So these companies, Norco, uh,

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:09,510
these two people, he's actually not,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,030
so I already was in touch with them,

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:17,230
so they ran a newsletter with us, I think it was,

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,360
um, a couple of months ago in the summer.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,800
So they had a conference and we were helping them,

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,040
uh, promote the conference. Doesn't matter.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,080
So I wanted to touch base with them again and see what theyre,

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,000
So Dev John and there is some other

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,960
guy, Robert I who, but he was also in cc.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,680
Um, so I want to, uh,

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,600
them again and see if they would be interested in,

14
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:52,000
uh, doing something else, Uh,

15
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,050
something more. So yeah,

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,690
we can probably turn this into a template.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,410
So here it would be, uh,

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,960
personalized line and this we can probably

19
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:08,440
keep for all the, all the plants.

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,680
Yeah. And the C is Kel. Yeah,

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,520
I, uh, just added them to companies here.

22
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:19,640
We, uh, it's actually one of the companies I asked to,

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,200
Yeah, Kel. So this is one of the companies that they asked you

24
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,160
to add. So I saw that they sponsored the conference.

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,000
They were sponsor, so probably they have money,

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,800
so that's why I wanted to ping them and see if they would be

27
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:39,500
interested in any ation. Yeah.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,310
So please create process doc for,

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,430
um, itching out to past clients,

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,910
