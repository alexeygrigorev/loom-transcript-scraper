1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:06,068
i think southern cloud paid the invoice anyway so this is not what i

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:10,678
wanted to show you here i wanted to show you how to in

3
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:15,523
invoices how do we specify the discount cost like there in the invoice

4
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:22,776
you sent where it is now

5
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:29,594
let me load it okay so okay

6
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:34,002
so the problem with this is that uh it's five slots but the quantity

7
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:36,843
is one it kind of looks ugly like in the previous case with the

8
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:41,470
double cloud like it was kind of weird to split it into two

9
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:46,037
uh places well we could have done this like promotion in

10
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:50,606
this letter then five or six emails and log on the website

11
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:55,475
with code zero we could have done that right anyways

12
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:59,202
so we the way we will do this the way we can do this

13
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:05,442
is new

14
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:10,774
document invoice and

15
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:13,641
then here we can say newsletter

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,691
and the price is uh the usual price 6

17
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:31,251
emails,

18
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:33,851
email, right?

19
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:37,331
And then we can add a discount.

20
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:44,733
Which would be 100,

21
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:49,393
or, Alright,

22
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,147
it's fine. Right,

23
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:57,297
so this is how we could do it, could do it with uhm uhm

24
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:02,046
with quack, because in this case it's clear that we're making

25
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:07,102
it. We're making a discount, so let's say if somebody is uhm I don't

26
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:10,207
know in their team maybe there's a new person,

27
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:12,931
let's say look like this was the price previously,

28
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,467
we could say that was a discount like this.

29
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,914
But here you see that on the uh on the invoice,

30
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:24,562
so this is this way it's more explicit that we are giving an explicit

31
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:28,112
discount because they are getting a large quantity.

32
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:30,396
So please do it like that.

33
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:34,784
I want your,
