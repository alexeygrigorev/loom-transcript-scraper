1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,250
Um, hi, I wanted to show you in plan on what to do when,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,790
when people get sore authors ask more information about events.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,880
So Stefan, I reached out to him.

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:19,800
I asked if he wants to take part in our podcast

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,980
and then yeah, he he's asking.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,160
I would, I would be very interested. How would this work?

7
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:30,420
And well, um, so it took a bit of time to get back to

8
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:34,980
him, but now I want to send him a document that describes what exactly

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,310
is it? I have a document here.

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,030
So just briefly describes what kind of programs would have .

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,440
And one of these things is,

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,350
uh, is ProQuest, uh,

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,630
quite detailed. So then here in this,

14
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:06,510
um, in this Google document and this Google document display away in,

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,080
uh, in this shared folder and documents,

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,840
and then there's this data dog's opulence and

17
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,990
year. Yeah. To get this link,

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
to get this thing that, uh, is shareable,

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,570
you can go file.

20
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,470
Yeah. This one published Philip, and then there is link,

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
but I will just send you this link right now.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,950
So you don't need to do that here.

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,070
And yeah, actually in this link, I will select because this,

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,850
um, this person is interested in podcast.

25
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,380
So I would, uh, click on this podcast Inc.

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,250
And I will probably,

27
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,900
you know, maybe I'll just send

28
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,210
the whole thing. Um,

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,250
and then I'll send you

30
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,550
the, we

31
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,040
Probably

32
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,120
pretty split. If you need more information

33
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,840
also, I want to ask him his email. Then I will send this email

34
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:45,010
to you and ask you to do take care of that also.

35
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,700
Nice. All your

36
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,280
email so we can,

37
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,960
um, uh,

38
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,910
yeah. So the main thing here I wanted to show you is that we

39
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:12,880
have this document and if somebody asks more information about events

40
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,220
and what exactly, let's say, what is it,

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,910
what exactly is a podcast that will help this document that we're going to

42
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:24,130
just share with guests and hopefully answers all the questions.

43
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,180
Probably add more information to this, um,

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,460
document at hand, uh,

45
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,950
important. What is important.

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,200
You also have access to this document.

47
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,630
So if you,

48
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,270
if we need, if you need to change it,

49
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,730
you can also do that. Okay.

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,940
That's that's all I want to do.
