1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,040
So I wanted to show how to add images to articles on our

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,720
blog, in our blog, on our website.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,300
So here's an article by Evalerio and we want to add

4
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:16,620
this image to the article.

5
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,075
So I want to show you how to do that. First,

6
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:25,445
for that, we will go to the website for

7
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:29,215
repository, GitHub repository for our website,

8
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:31,815
which is Datatalks.

9
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:39,116
So this is the whole URL.

10
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:43,756
And here we have posts.

11
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:47,436
So these are all the posts,

12
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,655
and this is the article that we have here, and this is the article

13
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:49,801
that we have here, and this is the article that we have here. And

14
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:53,141
this is where we want to add the image. Data engineering zoom cam. I

15
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:57,441
will now click on edit. We will edit this file right now.

16
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,301
And this is how the article looks like.

17
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:04,281
And this is how we add stuff.

18
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,829
Wait, this is how we add images.

19
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:12,649
So this is how images look like. And you see the path to

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,989
the images. So all the images are in the images folder in the posts

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,089
folder. Then there is a folder for the,

22
00:01:22,387 --> 00:01:25,787
article. And then this is the name of the image.

23
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,487
So this is the file we want to upload.

24
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,387
So we will need to go to that directory.

25
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:36,057
So this thing here is the,

26
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:40,125
the same as the name of this file. So we want to go there.

27
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:42,805
We want to upload this image there. So first of all,

28
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:47,095
I will rename it. I'll call it course over here.

29
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:54,399
And I will go now to images. Posts.

30
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,979
Then this is dating genie zoom cam.

31
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,159
And they want to upload the image. So I'll just click on add

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,159
file, upload file. And yeah,

33
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,659
I think I can just drag it here, drag and roll.

34
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:13,232
Or you can select the like choose the files here.

35
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:17,902
And this is the name. This is the name of the file.

36
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:22,942
I don't know if I can rename it,

37
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:26,117
but it doesn't matter at all. So I just commit the file.

38
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:32,377
Go back two times.

39
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,737
I pressed back two times. We will have this new file.

40
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:39,837
Force Overview to back. Right. So this is the file.

41
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:42,855
Now I will click. First,

42
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:47,595
I will take this thing. So this is how Image Stack looks like.

43
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:51,455
And this is where we will put it.

44
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:55,535
So we'll put it, let's see here. But we can change the position later.

45
00:02:56,682 --> 00:03:00,762
And from there, I need to know the file name.

46
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:05,462
Of course, over here, JPEG is the file name because the rest stays the

47
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:08,402
same, right? What if,

48
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:10,862
in an article, there is no image?

49
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:17,602
There still will be a folder, it generates automatically because

50
00:03:17,603 --> 00:03:22,242
we will always have this cover, so a folder will always be there

51
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,362
with the cover, but we might not have this figure,

52
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:29,565
image, whatever. I think so,

53
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:34,825
you will need to copy it. So we will make sure I was included

54
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:38,325
in the loom video,

55
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:43,485
so then when we if there is nothing to copy paste from,

56
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,957
then we'll copy paste from the process document.

57
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:50,497
It's a course over here, and then we can call this,

58
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:55,147
this p here is kind of optional but since others have it,

59
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:57,707
let's include it here, so it's definitely in,

60
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:01,371
in, in this heating. So,

61
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:08,171
I'll, you know, copy it we'll post it in in

62
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:12,631
the comments, but the important part here is the caption,

63
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:16,311
the title under the figure.

64
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:20,175
The image and I'll just take a course over here.

65
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:24,755
I think we don't see here.

66
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:29,015
And I just click commit changes.

67
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:35,015
So in total we'll make eight two commits. The first commit was uploading the

68
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:37,995
image and then the second one was changing.

69
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:43,775
And if there are multiple images, of course, like when we upload files,

70
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:48,978
we can upload multiple files. So I will not this

71
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:51,038
is just an example.

72
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:54,948
So I'll do this thing here,

73
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,948
right? And then,

74
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,958
yeah, okay. It's just a large file.

75
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:07,158
But, yeah, let's, say I can do something like that.

76
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:11,448
Let's upload multiple files. I don't commit that,

77
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,928
but this is how we can upload multiple images.

78
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:18,148
And then, in the second commit, we edit the file.

79
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:23,518
So right now I think if we refresh multiple times,

80
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:29,988
yeah, it takes a file to build so we can follow the

81
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:32,068
progress. Right now,

82
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:35,148
if we go to actions, we see that it's queued.

83
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:38,158
So once it has this check mark,

84
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:43,378
then the site is updated. It's being deployed right now,

85
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:46,818
so now when this is over,

86
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:50,858
then we should have a new updated version of the website.

87
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:58,111
Okay, it's done. Now use Ctrl F5 to

88
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:00,251
make sure we refresh, like,

89
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:04,371
also we don't use the cached version. And now we see the image.

90
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:08,551
Okay, so this is how you add images.

91
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:16,975
And let's say if you want to change the image,

92
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:22,275
so this image, let's say there is a mistake, and we want to update

93
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:25,360
the image, so then you can change the image, so you can change the

94
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:27,048
image. You do

95
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:39,498
it over again, so what you

96
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:39,938
can

97
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,079
do is, yeah, I think

98
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:39,939
I lost it, so in images, we can

99
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:40,139
Bye.

100
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:56,921
delete images, so here, hmm, how do I actually do this? There's an option,

101
00:06:56,922 --> 00:07:00,454
I think, to delete it. I don't remember how to do this, from the

102
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:04,614
web interface, but yeah,

103
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:07,634
so what we can do is just upload a course overview v2,

104
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,904
and then yeah,

105
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:15,519
there should be a way to, to delete it,

106
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,279
I don't remember, you know,

107
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:24,109
I guess we should google. Anyways,

108
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,589
when we need it we'll find a way,

109
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:30,621
but right now this is how, you would replace it,

110
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,722
so you would just upload a new file,

111
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,001
of course, over uv2, and then you would go to the post and update

112
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:40,191
the path to the image. Yeah,

113
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:44,191
so please make process documents for uploading a new image.

114
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:47,373
And also for replacing existing images.

115
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:53,453
And please share it with Valeria, the, I mean the the result of the

116
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:53,933
process documents.
