1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,480
So I also wanted to show you right now,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,030
I'm filling in the form for Ellen.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,700
And she said, it's fine to use your picture from LinkedIn.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,590
But I noticed that LinkedIn and there is this,

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,270
uh, firing save by corporate image and

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:23,140
then it will spell it. So this is not what

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,530
I do in this case. Go to Google and then type

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,620
personal name and then,

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,220
okay.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,930
Um, yeah, if there's an upside for you

11
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:46,680
and that's Jeff's picture, so then I I'll say this picture,

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,750
it's the same picture has it.

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,810
And then I do the same thing cause I do with pictures,

14
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,470
which is, um, I guess we need to them,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,020
so we don't need, we don't need this square pictures,

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,690
so then let me make

17
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,130
it a square.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,120
Shouldn't be in the sentence.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay. Now it's clear and it is,

20
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,590
do you want to know that maybe work?

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,580
Okay. Yeah. And that looks not

22
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,910
Okay. Just want to make sure that this is actually the same issue.

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,510
She's so probably to take

24
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:08,990
on other stuff.

25
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,180
Yeah. So this may be fine.

26
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,960
It's okay.

27
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,720
Like that is fine. I think so it looks similar

28
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:40,310
to that. Yeah. So the summary is LinkedIn.

29
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:43,250
Sometimes it's this thing stipes or whatever,

30
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,610
and I don't want to have them on the website as well.

31
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,200
Um, that's why I tried to paint this picture of the same feature somewhere

32
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,700
and then use that.
