1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,330
So just wanted to say a few words about,

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,330
uh, what to do with this when we accidentally have her wrong company here.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,410
So this one is not, um, let me close it.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,410
So I found that, uh, this, that this company is APA Kaka,

5
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:16,530
but it's actually not, uh, the right company.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,810
So we need to go here to this.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,730
Um, um, so right now I want to show you how we or

8
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:28,210
how we merge two records into one, right?

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,730
So here in this record, we have content and if we had people,

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,050
uh, contacts the procedure or deals,

11
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:38,930
the procedure would be the same. So I want to merge this two and

12
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,650
get rid of, uh, the Kafka record.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,490
Record. So I go to the content here and change

14
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:48,770
company from oops,

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,370
from Kafka to Confluent.

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,090
Why do we have to Confent?

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,370
Yeah, you will do this with, uh, this content,

18
00:00:58,371 --> 00:00:58,810
right?

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,090
So the direct Confluence. So we will need to merge them and,

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,850
uh, please do this with Confent. So now,

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,130
um, yeah, I updated it to Confent. And yeah,

22
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:12,290
by the way, when you do this with Confluent, you see that,

23
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,330
uh, there are two of them, or you cannot see it here,

24
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,370
but one has, uh, web,

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,850
web address, but web here, the other dozens.

26
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:25,130
So you all need to merge that too. Okay.

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,050
So that I did, and since we don't have any other,

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,490
uh, contacts, content, uh,

29
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,130
deals, we can just go ahead and where is it now?

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,250
I think I can just go back and then I see it,

31
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,050
and here in the dots we can just delete it,

32
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,450
right? So you will need to do it with the confent that has one,

33
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,050
two,
