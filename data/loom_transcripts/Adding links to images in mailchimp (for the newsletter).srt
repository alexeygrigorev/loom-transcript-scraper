1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,840
Yeah. I noticed that, um, to hear,

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:07,740
yeah, thanks for putting the picture and all this that it's not linked.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:12,690
So what we usually do is we link both the banner and

4
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:15,050
the bottom. So for the button,

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,640
you have the link, uh, for the banner.

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,490
We'll also have the link. So to add the link,

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,200
we click on the image, then link,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,790
and then they put the link here. So that's pretty much it because how

9
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:33,160
you do your endings to banners three images,

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:33,480
mail.
