1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,700
What was already in our,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,370
um, he was on our events.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,960
He showed up, he asked to modify his biography.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,200
So did it company. Okay.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,520
Yeah. So you sent a new biography.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,400
So I want to show you how to got to get up and

7
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:26,880
down. Actually, it shouldn't be up.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,670
And then I select this data docs,

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,700
club, guitar player. And this year we

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,200
have this underscore people and we need to find the

11
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:48,030
ranch. So he wanted to change

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,510
his biography. It could,

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,740
and I had a place in these things that we'll have here with a

14
00:00:55,741 --> 00:01:01,500
new one. It'd be Atlanta

15
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:06,330
breaks if you land breaks here. Okay.

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,730
So this is his new meal. Oh,

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,980
can be changes. And in a while,

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,580
if we'd gone to actions,

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,660
so now this thing will, is cured,

20
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,620
but someone, it will push an updated version to,

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,220
to our website. So that's all.
