1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,490
Um, hi, I am checking,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,360
um, this open-source spotlight spotlighting, and then notice that,

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,510
um, the things that aren't released yet.

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,940
So for example, this cow's genius,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,120
uh, um, the soda cl air bite,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,860
they are not released yet what they are already available in the

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,040
playlist. I'm right now in coding,

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,170
incognito mode. And the reason for that I think is because they're

9
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:32,910
probably already in the playlist. So let me check that.

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,780
Um, yeah, there's similar on,

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,110
for example, let me check it.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
Yeah. So Emma Loran is not in the playlist,

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,000
which is correct. So you shouldn't add them to playlist yet.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,440
Yeah. This one is a very,

15
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:05,070
so you only add to the playlist when you want three days at right

16
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,980
then this one is not, uh, I don't know.

17
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:10,190
Did you schedule it? You, you haven't scheduled it yet.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,740
Right. And by the way, other thing is,

19
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,380
uh, I know that Michelle sent,

20
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,170
uh, the timestamps in this format,

21
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,530
so you always need to add leading, um,

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,460
leading zeros. Right. So they all follow the same format.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,320
Maybe this one is covered. Yeah. So please,

24
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,510
uh, adjust, um,

25
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,810
process documents for that. And yeah.

26
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,070
So this, um, shouldn't be in the playlist until you really,

27
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,830
so when you schedule this, when it's scheduled,

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,400
then you should put it in there in the playlist,

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,230
because right now they,

30
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:53,160
they are accessible through, through the playlist,

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,470
even though they are unlisted. Yep.

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,700
That's all.
