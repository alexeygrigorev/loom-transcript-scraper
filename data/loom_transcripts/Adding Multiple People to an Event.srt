1
00:00:00,396 --> 00:00:05,235
So I thought it's faster if I just record the video about that

2
00:00:05,236 --> 00:00:06,509
So we go to

3
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:14,783
Why it's here anyways

4
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:23,028
How to make it go away Okay,

5
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:28,214
um So we go to data So

6
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:31,107
first of all what I want to show you is how to add two

7
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:33,800
people in one event, right?

8
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:38,417
So we have this events.yaml and the way it works is we

9
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:42,896
uhm when you fill a form there is only one field for adding an

10
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:45,446
author So let's say we,

11
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:51,105
right now what I will do is I will just remove

12
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:55,658
this thing So this is what happens when

13
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,142
you create an event through the form,

14
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:03,352
right? So a record like that is added to events.yaml So

15
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:05,970
if you want to add a second person here,

16
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:10,083
what you do is you click edit in the same way I clicked here

17
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:13,815
right now and then you add the second name here,

18
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:19,796
right? So this person should be added too through the form and

19
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:22,868
yeah that's pretty much it so you just add another person here,

20
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:27,669
commit changes and now I hope

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,413
this is the right one, let me check

22
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:37,145
yeah no, so this one is the right one,

23
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:40,158
so let me update it,

24
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:48,328
okay yeah, so this is

25
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,462
how we do it, and please find,

26
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:55,362
I think there must be a process document for that,

27
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:56,427
if not, let's create it.
