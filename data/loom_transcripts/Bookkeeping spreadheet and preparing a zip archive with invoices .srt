1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,180
<v 1>Um, okay, so now it's September the beginning of September,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,780
September, so it's time to file a declaration.

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:12,690
So if they need to do this at the beginning of every month,

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,370
um, for the previous month. So the first thing is

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,450
first thing they need to do is to add an extra line.

6
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,780
So I separate every month. Um, let me see,

7
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:30,900
like, so this is by the way,

8
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:34,740
it's sorted by the date when it's displayed by the date.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,870
So this date is when the invoice is issued and this

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,620
is the date when it's paid. So yeah,

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,390
for my invoices, that for our invoices that we issue usually

12
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:56,130
like the date when it's shoot and if it is different,

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,950
because companies takes a bit of time to do this.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,080
So yeah, it is sorted by the date when it's free and I separate

15
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,390
each month with a lens here.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,680
Yeah. So we'll have all these things, right.

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,430
And I need to send this to my bookkeeper,

18
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,410
to my accountant, and then she will file the support tool,

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,330
um, tax

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,520
tax, tax office.

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,230
Yeah. So the important thing here is to make sure that all the income

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,550
is declared. So, or,

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,650
uh, like this spending

24
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,510
<v 1>Of course spending is also important, but if I don't declare spending nothing

25
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,910
bad will happen, but if I don't declare,

26
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,870
uh, income, then I might go into jail.

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,520
So yeah, it's very important to make sure that we declare all the income

28
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:07,590
properly. So this year I have like war

29
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,800
five plants income. Right. So there are, there are things that,

30
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,920
uh, I received this month,

31
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,540
so I need to go to clinical and then go to,

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:19,980
uh,

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,180
so not all the money comes to Sonoma county.

34
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,920
So some of the money comes to, uh BuyPower or my other bank

35
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,020
account, but most of this comes to, you know,

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,560
so that's why, uh, we will check this and, you know,

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,390
so there should be five payments up

38
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,130
to where it is almost. So we check in August and then

39
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,570
we just have income

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,710
<v 1>In, by money coming in and

41
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,340
in August it was,

42
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,120
um,  here.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,160
Um, so checks than soda,

44
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,910
soda checks for COVID yeah,

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,210
the next, uh, uh,

46
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,170
yeah. Perfect. There are actually two payments from protect.

47
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,900
So this one and this one,

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,500
so they pay two times. So that's why it's one lines.

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,370
Yeah, that's perfect then.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,220
Um, or else we have this follow-up by,

51
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,420
yeah, we've got follow up here. Um,

52
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,660
we've got some money from this AI infrastructure,

53
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:44,380
Lance, Lance,

54
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,500
and then finally there was 5 cents here,

55
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,120
you know, so they return some money or some services.

56
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,600
So what's important is you see somethings here that

57
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:03,640
you don't see here, that it's very important to let me know if

58
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:09,910
you see some income, some money coming in here

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,690
and they are not in the keep keeping spreadsheet,

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,400
then we'll have to look at that step. And

61
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,440
so when it comes to voice in the,

62
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,640
or income invoices, so all the invoices.

63
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,180
<v 1>Yeah. So we have all the income invoices,

64
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,340
all the invoices that I send to companies

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,690
that are here. I don't know why.

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,440
So, um, uh,

67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,580
let me just check that. Uh, so we'll have,

68
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,390
we'll have soda because I,

69
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,260
I, I, you know, yeah.

70
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,140
I think, uh, all of them and,

71
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,070
uh, yeah, so to make sure that everything we need,

72
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,870
um, um, well there is another folder invoices,

73
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,060
right? So this is, these are the invoices for the payments

74
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,620
that we had and what I do to make sure that I don't forget

75
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,200
anything. So I enter once here.

76
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,840
So this invoice to invoice to my bookkeeper,

77
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,840
it's, uh, I don't have the invoice conviction was because it's a

78
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,520
automatic payment. So she just issued one invoice telling me that I need to

79
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:55,320
pay every month. That's why I don't look more like a physical invoice

80
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,520
here, but for the rest of they have physical invoices.

81
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,940
So that's why I add here once.

82
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,360
And what I do here is see, I select ones.

83
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,850
And then I see the sounds. Yeah. So 18 invoices.

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,790
And what I do now is I take all these invoices and then add

85
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,570
them to,

86
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,770
<v 1>No, I will change the name of this thing to data talks,

87
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,800
uh, uh,

88
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,920
in a month. I don't actually remember really name it.

89
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,680
So let me take this will,

90
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,590
what would hear? Yeah. It's data toxicity. These are the previous things I said

91
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,550
and okay, so here, insight,

92
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,000
12 items, and then now I will open

93
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:56,120
it

94
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:00,860
Thing.

95
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,490
<v 1>Okay. So now I'll go to incremental basis and take all

96
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,740
the invoices with plus.

97
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,970
So I take them, I copy them and I put them to the same

98
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:21,320
compressed zip folder. You see, they're kind of separated with the plus.

99
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,050
These are the invoices that,

100
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:27,170
where I got to money and Bisa,

101
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:30,800
that's where I paid. So in total we have 18,

102
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,590
which might just the number here, 18, right?

103
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,260
So we get all, we'll have all the invoices we,

104
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,810
we need, and this is how we prepare a file.

105
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,480
Um, and this is after this has prepared.

106
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,830
So what I do next is I go to invoices and then select all

107
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:56,780
the invoices for August.

108
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,350
So they send the same invoices I put in their file should be,

109
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,560
yeah, it's the 12th.

110
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,640
So I moved down to protest. Alright.

111
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,830
So the next time I don't see them,

112
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,570
but I prepare something for September and then the same

113
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:25,400
with income. So I take this on and I'm not

114
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:25,730
sure.

115
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,340
Um, and then these ones, we underscore these being voices that I shoot,

116
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,260
but they weren't made yet. Okay.

117
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,360
So this is how we prepare this file.

118
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,510
It's important to see that yet it's 18,

119
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,300
18.

120
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,880
<v 1>And, um, yeah.

121
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,780
So the most important thing is we have all the income that,

122
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,510
you know, that is also like fair all the invoices here

123
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,730
and all the things for the income are actually in the

124
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,330
document in this book, keeping, um,

125
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,640
yeah, maybe, um, another thing. So I will show you later in another

126
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,800
video, how to send this to the accountant,

127
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,010
but I see already that, so first of all,

128
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,490
there was the payment. So if I go to my funeral,

129
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,710
I see that there is a payment from, um,

130
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,770
to my accountant.  like

131
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:42,450
at the beginning of every month, so we need to edit here and

132
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,030
the way I did this,

133
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,220
so I will edit. And so today's date September,

134
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,370
September, and then, uh  um,

135
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,780
so, and then there is this line,

136
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,390
if this, the, what, the line I sent, um,

137
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,420
email, and usually like,

138
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:13,680
when you see it, you can go to the previous month and see how

139
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:16,860
exactly it was declared in the previous month.

140
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,030
So I want you to put it here and then for this one,

141
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:22,920
maybe you check the,

142
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,900
yeah. So you check that and go away.

143
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,490
Yes.

144
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,090
<v 1>So yeah, you check this total amount, total heart.

145
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,510
Uh,

146
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,750
but anyways, yeah, for this one, you just go to genome and see what's

147
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,480
the payment was the neuroscience,

148
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,300
uh, a dollar sent here.

149
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,620
Okay. I think that's all for now. And then I'll record you.

150
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:13,590
I'll send you a separate video for how to send this to,

151
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,410
uh, tax, uh, to my account.
