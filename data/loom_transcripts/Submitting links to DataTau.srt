1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,020
Um, hi, I just wanted to show you another website where we can share

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,360
stuff. It's called data towel.net.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,950
So in Datatel, so I already logged in,

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,260
you can create your own user here then

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,870
here in Datatel. Let me in the larger,

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:23,190
good little bit. So click submit. And then here you can say,

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,740
like, for example, for any events that we have,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,670
for example, if we have events, teaching data engineers,

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,830
you can ups, you can write teaching

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:37,740
data engineers, um,

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,840
uh, hopefully being our, or so,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,540
um, let me think what we can say it's podcast and through you cast

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,890
interview data talks go up right on down.

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,440
Euro would be this link,

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,500
right? So this is how you can, uh,

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,470
create things, submit things on data.

17
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,130
So we can try that maybe for a couple of months and see if

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,480
it works. Okay.
