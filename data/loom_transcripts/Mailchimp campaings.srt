1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,980
I want to show you around MailChimp MailChimp to

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:07,410
create a campaign, a newsletter,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,320
we need to go to campaigns and then, or complaints.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,310
And here I have a template which is called like that.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,500
So the easiest way to find it out.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,120
So go to all campaigns and then we'll have this

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,850
draft. And so this template,

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,500
so let me also keep the old one from

9
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,580
this and a new link.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,440
This is dropped complaints.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,190
Okay. So to create a new campaign,

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,830
I used this template from droughts,

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,050
which started with this template and I click here

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,170
on this thing and replicate

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,130
now here, when it implicate, the first thing I need to change is the

16
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:09,230
name. So be clear email.

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,480
So usually there is a number And then the last one was 68.

18
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,300
So 69,

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,270
then the date, this is when it goes out.

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,040
So it goes out on Mondays. So tomorrow will be 11th,

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,340
so 11th, and then next 18th 25.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,580
So this will be a real

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,760
2022. So this copy and

24
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:42,920
this sponsored and book of the week is,

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,710
are like features of this newsletter.

26
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,270
I'll explain later on for now. What can keep it out of this big

27
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:53,090
safe, and then immediately after that.

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,820
So it's 69, the goals here,

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,430
this combined link and change

30
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,330
This, this thing here,

31
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,610
2 69  will

32
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:11,090
be my old team data docs quo slash weekly six to nine.

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,660
And Yeah,

34
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,460
so now the template and

35
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,440
we need to edit design

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,120
and here in edit design, I,

37
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,140
there is no sponsored block this week.

38
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,400
Um, I will put something here, but I'm anti this.

39
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,640
I will not maybe record a separate video for that.

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,910
Um, and, um,

41
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,030
yeah, so for book of the week,

42
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,570
um, I think next week we'll have something,

43
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,200
let me check on the upside. So if we didn't

44
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,950
have any book of the week on the book,

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,650
so we'll click, just click delete block,

46
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,820
and then there will be no the week in the newsletter,

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,670
But we have something to the book of the

48
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:22,000
next week is interpretable machine learning by Christophe.

49
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,830
So I, what I do is I copy this link,

50
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,320
so I copy it. And then I go here,

51
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,080
click this Pen and

52
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:42,310
then say, look this And just paste.

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,810
And then it's important that there is no place with them.

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,740
And now we need to insert the image and image of the image of

55
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:56,440
the book. So according to the book, I right,

56
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:58,240
click copy image address.

57
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,670
And now this course away You,

58
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:08,860
we need to insert an image, the image and year,

59
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,980
instead of board, I click on this,

60
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,490
uh, from dropdown list input from Euro And

61
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,330
I put the other assay here. I

62
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,250
am important. Oh,

63
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,890
wow. It's huge. So we don't need it that

64
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:35,540
week. So the beat will be 160 and then

65
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,870
you automatically adjust the height.

66
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,370
And then the link is actually incredible.

67
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,700
So yes, open in a new window And I just saved.

68
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,060
So I also want to check the correct link once.

69
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,800
So keep pressing control and then click it

70
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,200
doesn't work. Okay. LinkedIn,

71
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:07,640
your top. Yeah.

72
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,490
So again, right-click open Lincoln in your top five

73
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,800
that this is the correct link. And then I do the same with the

74
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:18,920
image. So the link is correct.

75
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,510
So, okay. Next one. We need to feel in Lacy ones.

76
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,450
And for that again, go to the pub side and just copy all

77
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:36,260
the events And waste them here.

78
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,320
Sometimes it's paced like it and then two lion

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,530
at the beginning. And then at the end, these should,

80
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,220
uh, we should remove them. This happens sometimes.

81
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,550
Sometimes it doesn't, I don't know why, but yeah,

82
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,680
there should be no points here

83
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,540
Then. Yes. Then the next thing we need to fill in is

84
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:07,190
the podcast. So the latest podcast episode is this one

85
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:11,840
with these both click And then select

86
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,590
this one. And yeah, so this is the most recent one.

87
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,550
And then before that I get three,

88
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,030
three episodes before episodes,

89
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,670
before that, and copy them here.

90
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,020
I'm going to switch more or less in this thing.

91
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,980
So there is no sponsoring book, but they still want to

92
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,980
write something here. So I want to write a short description about,

93
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,310
Um, oh wait,

94
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:51,450
actually it's got funds from the next week. So yeah,

95
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,730
I will remove the sponsored book.

96
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,000
And for that, what I do is I just click,

97
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,280
delete, Think

98
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,400
The term.

99
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,700
<v 1>Okay. Yeah.

100
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,480
So this is the newsletter this week.

101
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,620
<v 1>All right.

102
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,390
And Yeah,

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,280
let me check.

104
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,450
Yeah. Check it,

105
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,490
but nevermind. So have the intro

106
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,170
and then join slack, then a book will check that things work.

107
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,400
So these links also should work. We don't need to check them because they

108
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,690
are presumably correct on the website and when we copy them from the website,

109
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,920
um, it copies the link as well. And yeah,

110
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:59,340
I think this should also be correct. Okay.

111
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,780
Thank you.

112
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,290
You want, and then also let me,

113
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,280
Um, show you how you schedule this.

114
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,210
We need to change this object And for the subject,

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,860
I just arrived in therapy.

116
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,290
And then I don't know. Maybe we'll get some nice emoji,

117
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,230
But yeah, I don't think you need to do that for the

118
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,370
sake of completeness. I'll just Show you what I do.

119
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,160
Um,

120
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,590
Maybe this could be In nice emoji

121
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:06,960
And for preview textile and here we

122
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:07,200
are.

123
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,790
Okay. So now I want to preview that things work.

124
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,140
So right now I want to check that this button,

125
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,500
this button works. You see that here in the left

126
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,300
bottom corner, we have the link is trying to data docs.club,

127
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,160
so that incorrect, and then we'll hold it and check the links.

128
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,790
Okay. So now we'll

129
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,690
do the sponsor thing because this is not a sponsor

130
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,790
and click on schedule. So I want to schedule it.

131
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,550
And usually I scheduled for,

132
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,500
Uh, 10, 10 him,

133
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,810
these GMT plus two,

134
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,770
Do they actually say,

135
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,060
Okay.

136
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,370
Yeah. Just double check. That campaigning is the name is correct.

137
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,450
Yeah. So it's actually related to Ms. Kiddo And I scheduled

138
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,450
for 10, 15,

139
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,650
April 11, Monday,

140
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,010
and I scheduled the complaint.

141
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,770
And now I have to look that I can check again that this

142
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:05,500
link is correct. Um,

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,790
So this is what people will receive tomorrow.

144
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,690
Okay. So for that, I want you to document multiple things from

145
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:21,610
that video. So the first thing is how you clone an event and

146
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,890
then how you feel in, sorry,

147
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,680
call your cologne newsletter campaign,

148
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:33,040
then how you feel in book of the week events

149
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,120
and, um, podcast blocks.

150
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,130
And then for sponsored content,

151
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,410
or maybe next week when we'll have a sponsored content for now,

152
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:52,030
you can also document how to delete things and then maybe

153
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:56,740
as a different document, like how you schedule the campaigns.

154
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,230
Yeah. That's it.
