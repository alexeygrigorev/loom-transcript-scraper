00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hi, so I wanted to show you how to check if I

2
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:08,600
can do a podcast on Monday.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,260
In general, I want to show you how things are organized

4
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:17,280
in my calendar. So now you have access to my calendar.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,500
You should be able to edit everything there and see what is there.

6
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:30,542
So I wanted to show you an example when I cannot do a podcast

7
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:35,402
at the usual time. So this is the usual time for the podcast.

8
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:39,042
It's happening. It's 5 p.m.

9
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:42,202
So this is my time, brilliant time, 5 p.m.

10
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:44,862
And I already have this event block.

11
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:48,067
So it happens. I have the block on every Monday,

12
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:51,647
so it's always there. So this is just to make sure that people do

13
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:55,387
not accidentally put anything there or,

14
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:58,527
um, look allenly.

15
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:04,087
Okay, so here next week I'm busy. And by the

16
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:06,987
way, yeah, we need to just get all that to noon,

17
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:10,576
for example. Okay,

18
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:13,396
so here the block is there.

19
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:17,836
It's always there. But I have another event there.

20
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:21,476
So this is the event. That's why I cannot make,

21
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,976
cannot do a podcast on this time.

22
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:27,496
So you should be able to see this, and you should be able to

23
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:29,856
see if I can do on this Monday at this time.

24
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:34,121
So by default, we should try to do this. What should be the default

25
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:36,421
time is Monday,

26
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,921
5pm. Like previously it was Friday, 5pm.

27
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,521
Yeah, but if I already have something in my calendar, then we should try

28
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:47,141
to maybe have it on Tuesday.

29
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:49,461
If there is nothing on Tuesday or no.

30
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:54,821
So Tuesday would be preferred if the speaker can.

31
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:57,464
And not do it in the morning or in the at noon.

32
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,724
Because at noon, uh, yeah,

33
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:05,904
like let's say if they are from Central European time,

34
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:08,344
then noon should be fine. But if they are from the States,

35
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,524
they can not do it at noon. So then we can try to find

36
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:15,024
it Tuesday. And then on other days I am not available.

37
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:18,448
And uh,

38
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:20,828
yeah, here is another example where,

39
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,508
uh, so here, this is an event, right? So,

40
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:28,848
let's make something. And here is another example where I cannot,

41
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:34,388
um, I cannot do it on Monday

42
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,748
15th, right? Then we will need to schedule the broadcast at some other time.

43
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:41,961
So this is the after how it works. You should be able to have

44
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,901
access to this if you don't let me know. So this is my Gmail

45
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:47,981
account. And yeah,

46
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:49,861
so this is how you can see.
