1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,150
Sometimes they can get this mails from people who cannot try and slack to

2
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:08,520
say, try and train community.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,480
But haven't  I think so.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,250
And they usually send me emails. So what I'm doing in this case is

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,520
I copied their email. Then I go to slack.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,430
Then I click here,

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,980
invite people, and then the email could accent.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,180
So if a sound and then I click it down,

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,670
sometimes it's actually says that this person is already in slack.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,120
So maybe because they wrote this email,

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,840
but they received the, actually they receive the invite.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,840
So then the slack says that person is already there.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,080
Um, yeah, this wasn't the case.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,750
So in this case, when it sent,

15
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,330
they invited it was successful.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,600
Yeah. And then I go here and they reply saying,

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,280
um, can I just

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,350
check your email

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,300
are right?

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,240
And then they could extend. And if,

21
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:31,770
for example, slack would tell me that this person is already there in my

22
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:36,720
reply, I will say, Hey, it seems like you've already managed to register.

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,600
You still would have chemo. Right. Or go to something I can help with.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,820
And yeah. So this is how I invite people to,

25
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,330
uh, to slack when they have problems. And,

26
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,610
uh, the reason I'm showing it to you,

27
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,220
because this is not the first,

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,950
uh, I have a bunch of things.

29
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,080
So for you,

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,120
yeah. I will not add anything here.

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,480
So you can just maybe add them on,

32
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:09,090
let me have a bit of time. So this is called an wait people

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,610
and I will appreciate your help with that.
