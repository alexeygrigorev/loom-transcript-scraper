1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,720
Here. I want to show how to add timestamps,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,660
uh, chapters,

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,270
uh, time codes to any YouTube video.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,290
So speaker guest for one of our events.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,650
So he, I asked him to prepare a timestamps,

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,020
uh, 10 quotes for the video.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,250
So he sent the video. So let me know from the video where we

8
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:27,540
want to . So I go to YouTube studio,

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,230
then it is content.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,270
So this is the, this video is this open source spotlight or cast.

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,480
So, uh, he did this presentation and then he prepared

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,440
the time codes. So now we need to put these timecards there.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,010
So the times called 10 quads, he prepared are not,

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,920
uh, this is, uh, the format is slightly different,

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,850
so I'll need to adjust it slightly. So we only need the beginning.

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,680
We do not need the end. So now I will need to remove to

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,250
the end.

18
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,280
So I don't anymore. Would I use a feature from visual

19
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:12,470
studio code called multiple or serve?

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,770
You don't have to use this. You maybe can digitally by a one by

21
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:18,200
one, whatever is convenient for you.

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,210
And yeah, so I think this time codes,

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,920
uh, I'm good enough. So now I just copy this,

24
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,700
um, based this to the video in that click save,

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,910
and now let's check that it actually works so I could hear

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,100
it's nice to meet you as well.

27
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,890
And we see that, uh, it edit this chapters production pipeline

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,920
demo and so on because we edit them here.

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,950
The important thing here, this, the first timestamp,

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,810
the first time code should always start with 0, 0 0 0 0 0 time.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,720
Otherwise YouTube will not pick this as chapters.

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,480
Um, yeah. So this is how you add 10 codes to a YouTube video.
