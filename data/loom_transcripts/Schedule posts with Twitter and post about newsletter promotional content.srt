1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,420
Yeah, for Hootsuite connect to Twitter,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,630
because I'm where I am on the free plan.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,230
I don't want to pay money for that. Um,

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,530
so I just want to show you how to use this simple Twitter interface

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:18,330
for scheduling. So the process is the same a

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:26,460
kit title. We get a description We'll

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,350
probably here because

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:36,060
we need to limit the

9
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:38,700
first. Let me copy it.

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,700
So then instead of the text here for free,

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,220
uh, You send emoji

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,730
and just less space and then take the link And

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,510
yeah, actually, No,

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,660
I'll just call data engineering conference,

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,430
the date, France

16
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,840
And data engineering Solution

17
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,930
and challenges, Um,

18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,340
books.

19
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,810
So something like that. Um,

20
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,090
and then, Uh,

21
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:49,620
we'll schedule it For

22
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,730
Three Or 4:00 PM,

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,500
two days, four days, five,

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,200
Uh, three, 4:00 PM.

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,650
And then I just click confirm. And then now I

26
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:16,070
just scan. So this is how it was scheduled things,

27
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,200
um, with Peter. So this involves a bit of creativity.

28
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:25,910
So maybe before posting, you can run it by me to see like

29
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:29,510
when it doesn't fit and you need to do some things,

30
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,650
you can kind of run things by me Before publishing,

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,800
but yeah, this is how you're scared of things with Peter.
