1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,020
Hi. Yeah. I just wanted to talk about this part,

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,630
this part. Um, So when we

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:12,720
<v 1>C

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,290
When we make an announcement about the book of the week thing,

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:19,940
<v 1>Um,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,120
And yeah, usually at the beginning,

7
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:30,280
we say at the beginning of the week,

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,650
we'll say that, uh, yeah,

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,290
this thing, and as a separate message,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,560
you can say that in a dish to

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,870
the motion, You

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
can ask her Name and then just

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:51,850
put

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,330
<v 1>This thing.

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,020
This shouldn't be actually like

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,960
Something like this, And this is what you do that

17
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:11,640
you shouldn't do that. So maybe when you probably schedule this as your schedule

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,220
<v 1>Check,

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,050
When you say custom time, they can schedule one,

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,910
or I don't know, seven 30 and then the next

21
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,670
one, it will be seven 30.

22
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,670
One that is if you schedule it,

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,060
but then they kind of come one after another.

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,200
I don't know what actually happens if you schedule them at the same time,

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,290
if they will come in the same order, maybe they will.

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,370
I don't know. But yeah, this is what you need to do when you

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,320
now, please, if they provided these questions or this extra things

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,470
Now, so please suggest the,

29
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,430
this process document to improve that.
