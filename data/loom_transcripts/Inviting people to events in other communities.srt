1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,780
So data stop is not the only community.

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:07,470
There are other communities. And I also can go in them and sometimes I

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:10,680
come across. Interesting people put example is,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,850
uh, so he is, uh, um,

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,790
yeah, he built some open source tools.

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:21,480
So I want to reach out to him and invite him to open source

7
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:27,970
spotlight. So I will invite you to Do

8
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:30,270
this community as well. So you will get an education,

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,890
but to here, I want to show you what I do.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,950
So next time, maybe if I see somebody interested,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,690
interesting, I'll just Send

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,190
you a message to reach out to them.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,260
<v 1>So

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,070
One

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,000
<v 1>Message

16
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:50,640
To them.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,840
Uh, so now I'll introduce myself and say that I

18
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,640
At this and I will not settle certainly about,

19
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,730
<v 1>Um,

20
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,760
Yeah. So this is how you can reach out to authors of open source

21
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,620
tools in other communities. And I will now invite you to this one and

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,980
perhaps to others. So you will get a notification.

23
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,830
You will get an email right now,

24
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,130
please email and register in these communities.
