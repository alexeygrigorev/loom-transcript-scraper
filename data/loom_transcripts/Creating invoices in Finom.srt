1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,280
Alright. So I will show you how to create invoices in email,

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,090
um, and go to documents,

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,950
documents. And I think you can actually beginning,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,940
so you can just click on this new document.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,710
I think you don't need to go to you.

6
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:24,780
Don't need to go to documents. So just pick one

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,910
and then you create invoice, uh,

8
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:53,160
here in the invoice. So

9
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:57,720
we need to send them an invoice to our new sponsor called arise.

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,310
We don't get them yet, so we need to add a new contact.

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,170
So they are from, so this is actually the contract with them.

12
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:13,080
So they are from the United States. That's

13
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:18,800
the name you states

14
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,560
of America. Business name is arise.

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,670
AI that's the main company.

16
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,140
So, uh, they don't have the number they do have address.

17
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,440
So there is is, so this is this name,

18
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:37,790
I think,

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,120
um, I don't know.

20
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:52,500
I guess this postcode is school,

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,830
the most cold, and this is the

22
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,420
<v 1>CT,

23
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,200
So we don't need, we don't change anything else.

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,420
And we see that the others make sense.

25
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:15,190
It's similar to do what do we come here?

26
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,930
So, yeah,

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,640
that seems to make sense. So that's

28
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:27,960
the other S and now the things we'll want to send to them is

29
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,910
yeah, so they are our sponsors and contracts.

30
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:38,530
We need to send them, we need to send them

31
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,750
voices four times. So let me check.

32
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,350
Um,

33
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,830
<v 1>There's this?

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,770
Yeah, so it's 16.

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,960
Awesome invoice needs to be paid within 30 days.

36
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,930
So, and then, because it's important statements I will,

37
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,970
so are silver sponsors, the silver sponsorship is

38
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,440
first opened and I will.

39
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,540
Whoops. So for me

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,560
to put here,

41
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,350
so, and then the price is 16 for

42
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,610
just 4,000.

43
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,900
Um, and because they are in the United States of America,

44
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,140
they do not need to have any VAT.

45
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,030
And so it'd be at ease. You know, it's not a big deal if

46
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:09,580
they are in Europe. So for example, let me show you some

47
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,150
example,

48
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,750
This one, Brussels. So they are from Belgium,

49
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,870
it's European union. And if we do this,

50
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,190
we VAT is zero and we need to add the

51
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:31,060
notes percent charge.

52
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,270
So we need to do this. We always need to write these in terms

53
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:38,860
of notes. If we send to somebody within the European union except Germany.

54
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,500
So in Germany.

55
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,770
So for example, this is a German company,

56
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,450
then this goes away and we need to add 19% VAT,

57
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,190
but that's not how it works. So if Germany then VAT is 19%

58
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,170
in all the other cases, it's zero. And if it's

59
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:06,220
within Europe, then we need to write within,

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,450
I think we didn't get a beam unit. Then it's a VAT.

61
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,200
0%

62
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:24,540
Church. Yeah. And since we're writing this to rice,

63
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,030
because they are in the United States of America who just leave the AP zero and

64
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:34,860
two do not get any, okay.

65
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,330
You didn't write. I always,

66
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,780
I tend to make mistakes in this world.

67
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,620
So it's actually should be one, two.

68
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,130
I think it's like British too.

69
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,960
And then, um, in November,

70
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,810
issue them sometime another invoice,

71
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,870
which will be this one from December,

72
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,660
then another one from March may and so on.

73
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,710
Yeah, you probably don't need to, I don't know. You need access to this

74
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,950
one. Maybe I will try to access data.

75
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,480
Um,

76
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,410
No, I think that's for

77
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,960
procreation and invoices and I will later show you how to

78
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:33,570
create invoices or just let them,

79
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,740
or when I need to make money. Oh, maybe I can show you right

80
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,410
now. So you mentioned that, um, rice needs to,

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,580
uh, so I will say to me some ways I'll wait,

82
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,400
I actually need to edit this. Yeah.

83
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:52,410
We need to base,

84
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,970
like, we can always give 30 days for due date.

85
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,110
The issue date is today, 15 posts,

86
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,450
and then this is the invoice number. So usually it's a year.

87
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,330
And then, um, and then just,

88
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,420
and distinct is not updated automatically.

89
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,640
So the next time you create an invoice, it might be September,

90
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,340
but this one would motivate, so we'll need to change this.

91
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,380
Okay. So I think here,

92
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,230
and then this invoice, we can do like preview document and we can

93
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,330
download this and then send it to our

94
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:41,150
contacts. I will show you how to do this,

95
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:45,170
but for now, I want to show you, but I want to show you

96
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:49,680
a call to the invoices or emails or

97
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,550
newsletters. So let me create new document let's

98
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,200
and let's say we want to send invoice to,

99
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,980
for example, this one

100
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,870
promotion, because they are in Germany,

101
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,450
we select 19% and then we select their,

102
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,540
uh, the date. So for example,

103
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:40,610
And an aisle or a post,

104
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:50,280
and it would be there's 2022.

105
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,890
So this is all we do. Yeah.

106
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,080
For prices. Think I will just tell you every time,

107
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:07,510
how much we need to repeat their invoices

108
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:10,990
on maybe one more thing. So let's say if somebody wants to do two

109
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,260
promotions with us, so then,

110
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,180
uh, so they want to do two weeks and it just looked like this

111
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,060
search will be two items for each promotion,

112
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:24,110
which would be separate one.

113
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,280
I don't think it's okay.

114
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:40,380
So the next thing I wanted to show you is how to sense these

115
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,900
document. It is save it, save it.

116
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,390
Oh, awesome.

117
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,090
22. And,

118
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,580
uh, and name is

119
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,700
the name. And like,

120
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:10,880
I kind of be actually let's rename it to make it convenient or

121
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,860
<v 1>S**t.

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,370
So for example, this one is sponsorship could be put

123
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:33,400
down this to know what this thing is about.

124
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,800
Just one second. Okay.

125
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,840
So yeah, I called them to invoice contact or our ice

126
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,180
is this one. So just pull it to

127
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,810
Swan until, so we will Emily to CC

128
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:06,550
<v 1>Case.

129
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,450
So now we will send them

130
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,350
to

131
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,160
<v 1>Yeah.

132
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,430
And then

133
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,100
<v 1>This is cool.

134
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:25,960
Yeah.

135
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,550
Yeah. Um,

136
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,100
yeah.

137
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,060
<v 1>Oh

138
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,840
Yeah. So we just send it.
