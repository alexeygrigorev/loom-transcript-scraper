00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:04,950
Hi, so I want to show you how to send emails with

2
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:08,787
sponsorship, it's not a sponsorship tag,

3
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:12,636
but like with our media kit. So there is the link,

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,683
I will send you this link right now,

5
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:16,818
or I will include it.

6
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:19,449
I will get, I guess I'll add it to the loom video.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,502
So this is the link I usually send to potential sponsors that describes what

8
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:28,106
the community is about and what kind of things we can offer to

9
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:32,656
potential sponsors. And this guy is a potential

10
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:37,244
sponsor. So what I want to do is send him an email

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,752
that, with this thing basically.

12
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:45,413
Uhm, and I want in the future you to help me do that.

13
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:49,649
So what we can say is eh hey name,

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,525
so hey Jim following up and then here

15
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:56,828
we would insert on that,

16
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:02,134
usually it would be our conversation in LinkedIn or our conversation

17
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:07,089
in Slack or whatever, here is the document

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,329
that describes things we can potentially do together,

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,172
please take a look and let me know if anything there is interesting

20
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,899
for you. So in this case,

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,274
let us know, so when you write instead of writing,

22
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,486
let me know, let us know.

23
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:28,912
And then perhaps, so since the email will be from you,

24
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:33,317
you can say, hey Jim, following up on our conversation from LinkedIn,

25
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:35,540
I want to send you this document, uhm,

26
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,929
one more time. Hey Jim,

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:44,671
I'm Francis from DataDocsClub and

28
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:49,293
I wanted to follow up on the conversation we started in LinkedIn and

29
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:54,132
we want to send you this document that describes things that we can potentially

30
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:58,352
do together yeah,

31
00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:03,054
if you want to talk more about anything there please let us know.

32
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:05,896
So that would be the template, we will reiterate on that,

33
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,000
but please send it to Jim.

34
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:14,748
Why it's him? Jim. Uhm,

35
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:19,033
it's probably Jim, not him, because like J and H are close.

36
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:24,343
So send it to Jim at hopsworks.ie

37
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:29,150
and send this document. And I will include the links in the comments of

38
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:31,644
this sloom. And yeah,

39
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:33,786
before sending this, run it by me,

40
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,883
then let's create a template.

41
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:40,829
And then we will send sometimes like

42
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,464
I reach out to somebody and they say okay send an email and then

43
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,029
I'll just ask you to do that.
