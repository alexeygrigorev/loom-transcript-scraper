00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,410
Hi. I came across an issue today,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,320
so this, uh, player wasn't working.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,160
Um, so it was, uh, playing a different,

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,720
uh, episode. It was playing episode with Kai,

5
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:14,040
Kate, Katie, uh,

6
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:19,600
instead of this one. And the problem there was that we accidentally

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,080
use strong url and the reason we use strong url,

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,280
so this is the URL you submitted in the form.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,200
And the reason this is, uh, a wrong hero.

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,070
Now, if I go to Anchor and let's

11
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:35,590
say get one of the episodes,

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,200
this is I think how we do it, right?

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,600
<v 1>Um,

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,760
So open a text editor. So this is how the,

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,160
this looks like, right? So it's, uh,

16
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,840
different now. So what,

17
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,200
uh, you can do, there are actually multiple options.

18
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:56,120
The first one, we just go to our public page,

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,320
this listen on anchor, and we have,

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,480
you know, we have this one, right? So just click on this one and

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,880
use this. So when you, uh,

22
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:10,800
put it in the form,

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,720
<v 1>Like

24
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,640
Where's k

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,480
<v 1>K?

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,770
So when you fill the form here,

27
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:21,690
table form. So you put this link here.

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,670
So this link goes here to anchor,

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,950
right? Not this one. So you can compare these students,

30
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:33,750
right? So it should be not this Spotify anchor web,

31
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,270
blah, blah, blah, but anchor found data doc stop episodes and this one,

32
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,430
right? And then if the URL looks like that,

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,510
then uh, we will not have problems,

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,150
uh,

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,260
<v 1>Well

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,990
With, um, you know, the player because,

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,910
um, the, the script that you execute when you submit a form,

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,710
it's actually, I don't know what's

39
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:04,750
happening with my computer. Yeah, it's actually looking at this URL and uh,

40
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:08,270
extracting this part. So that's why,

41
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,240
yeah, instead of, uh, doing it the old way,

42
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,480
go to our public website webpage of anchor,

43
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,700
which is, um, this one,

44
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:22,300
or it is,

45
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,290
<v 1>Um,

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,610
Yeah, but I usually go it from here.

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,290
But this it's anchor.fm/data Talk Club.

48
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,610
This is our public page,

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,080
right? And then copy the D.

50
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,840
So in the same way you do from Apple or from Spotify,

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,320
um, we also need to do it this way from Anchor Now,

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,000
cause the, the D that anchor give are,

53
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,690
uh, different, they and also work.

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,130
So maybe this one is simpler for you. So you can just paste it

55
00:02:55,131 --> 00:03:00,210
here in the browser and you see that it redirects and then it's,

56
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,090
it becomes very long. So we need to remove everything after the question mark.

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,330
So we don't need any, everything, anything that comes after the question mark.

58
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,050
And then at end we end up with the same Euro.

59
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,850
So these are the two ways you can get the right euro.

60
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,810
So next time when I you upload, um,

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,690
um, when you create a page, please use one of these two.

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,170
So right now, what you will need to do is update the process doc

63
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,010
to include, um, yeah,

64
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:36,090
you can include both, uh, both options,

65
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,330
right? Uh, actually maybe it's simpler,

66
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,570
uh, if you just say about the public page,

67
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:47,970
right? I think this way it's consistent with others like how you get it,

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,170
uh, from uh, Apple Podcast,

69
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,650
Spotify, then the same way you get it from Anchor.

70
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,970
So yeah, please mention only that one and the second one is more like

71
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,730
for your information. Okay,

72
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,250
That's fine.
