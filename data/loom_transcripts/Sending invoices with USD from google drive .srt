1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,650
Yeah, another thing. So we send sometimes invoices,

2
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:08,870
like I need to make invoices, um,

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,780
not in keynote, but outside. So for that,

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,060
uh, me open, uh, drive,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,790
I will show you. So then what's is already prepared.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,950
Uh, we'll make a separate video to show you how to make

7
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,050
this invoices. Um,

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,500
right now under the invoice is already there. So just go to the Arabs,

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,520
um, invoices and here,

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,290
you know, this, uh, Nvidia GTC invoice.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,350
So they already have help in ways, and this is what the theft

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,980
in the invoice. So the reason I need to

13
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:52,320
make this in ways outside of, you know,

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,330
here's me, Cosentino I cannot make invoices in USD in dollars

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,490
in phenomenal. I can only do them in Euro,

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,220
in euros, but Nvidia works with,

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,110
um, USD only. So they don't work with them on with yours.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,570
So this is the invoice I have. So you can see that actually the

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,700
format here of the invoices is month 10.

20
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:19,410
So she is D slash one. So it's like 1, 2, 3, 4 every month.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,450
So let's say it would have something,

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,690
uh, 10, uh, in October it will be also something like one issue

23
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:28,680
day to be.

24
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,490
Um, Hmm. So let me just at

25
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,100
there's um,

26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,830
we have, because it's August, so make it a,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,980
Hmm. Actually, I don't know. I think they have,

28
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,190
yeah, I think they asked me to send the invoice on the day of

29
00:01:56,191 --> 00:02:00,840
the promotion, so I will need to do send it on a Keith,

30
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,470
but clearly in g-mail we can schedule it.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,180
So here you see on next. So probably I can also,

32
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,650
yeah, I can do this as well, but yeah, you will be doing this

33
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:17,110
strong g-mail so advocacy.

34
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:20,590
This is my Datadog's popping. Well, not Gmail.

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,560
Um, yeah, so let me, you should, anyways,

36
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,510
so we will send it on the 5th of September,

37
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,220
but typically you would put today's date and send it immediately without the delay.

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,400
That's Lisa stain wise. And then what I do is I download this invoice

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,480
in PDF. Um,

40
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,760
I open it

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,770
and I go to Dropbox and in Dropbox or yeah,

42
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:01,330
there's paper work and income invoices.

43
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,240
So this is a, the invoices we send to companies and I actually already

44
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,290
have this in the west. So you see that the form is,

45
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,490
uh, it's it's, uh,

46
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,020
this is the same invoice section on unloaded and I already in this folder.

47
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,840
So that's the same one.

48
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,340
And, uh, yeah, so the forum is because it's not paid yet.

49
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,500
It's underscore then the month, then the company I'm here GTCs and just the

50
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,840
kind of service theme they want.

51
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,360
Okay. So what I do now with this is I take this in a

52
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,880
voice and yeah,

53
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:48,150
I think, um, so there, this is unusual.

54
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,370
So usually you don't need to do this, but here they asked that,

55
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,670
uh, please send to all your invoices with the key or number reference in

56
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:00,870
PDF format. So I don't know if they mean that I should reference key

57
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:03,990
or number in PDF inside or just here.

58
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,950
So I did mention it here, so right.

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,720
Please find a voice or

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,280
<v 1>Attach it

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,350
To that. But I don't know. Maybe they meant that I need to add

62
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:22,080
this PO somewhere here. Again,

63
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,220
this is not typical. So you don't need to put this insight in the

64
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:28,860
process document, but here,

65
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:32,340
I just want to show you the flow of what happens if the invoice

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,520
is outside of, you know what,

67
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,590
since I'm doing it here, let me do it.

68
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,400
So I'll,

69
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,590
I don't know. I'll put it here maybe.

70
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,260
<v 1>Yeah,

71
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,080
Well, I'm going to do it here so they will hopefully figure this out.

72
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,350
So I had done loaded again

73
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,600
and then I go to the invoices

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,520
and I will replace the spawn.

75
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,260
<v 1>So

76
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,080
We would replace it with this one. Um,

77
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,310
let me make sure that it actually, yeah,

78
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,210
so it has this deal reference here and

79
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,410
yeah. So now lets me touch it.

80
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,780
Um, or just leasing media,

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,280
<v 1>Hold on.

82
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,560
And then right now I will send it a it,

83
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,910
so date. So it would

84
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,980
be this one and date,

85
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,970
um, let's say,

86
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,240
um, no, so they are based in the states,

87
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,060
so probably it will be already pays for them.

88
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,040
Okay. Yeah. Let me check.

89
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,920
Uh, so again, this PO stuff is unusual,

90
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,210
but they have some email to which sentence,

91
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,310
the invoice. Then Susan wrote me this.

92
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:42,150
So I included her in CC, but my a mark is the person who

93
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,870
I actually got in touch to about promotion.

94
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,990
So that's why he's also in CC, um,

95
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,770
score.

96
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,670
Okay. So I think that's enough. So just send it.

97
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,810
Yeah. Um, again here,

98
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:09,300
the main thing I wanted to show you is how you,

99
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,310
and yet, uh, that we actually have this folder invoices

100
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,580
in this folder, we have invoices outside of,

101
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:21,150
you know, then we need to send this invoice.

102
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,660
You follow the same procedure as previously with genome,

103
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,430
except you download this and a, you put this to the invoices,

104
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:32,310
folder, invoices, income invoices.

105
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:37,020
So I will tell you more later, what exactly is all the structure

106
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:40,530
is because we don't only have the invoices that are,

107
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,460
um, we're on Google drive. We also have you see,

108
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,540
maybe I'll tell you right now. So you see, we have this plus thing.

109
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,970
So this plus is already paid invoices.

110
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,960
And so this is, was from ,

111
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,340
but yeah, I, this month soon,

112
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,060
I think it's actually tomorrow. Yeah. Tomorrow I will be preparing tax

113
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,350
report. So I will talk more about what we have here.

114
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,340
Exactly. Okay. So.
