1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,280
We already have a video about creating newsletter

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,340
issues from templates. We just want,

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:13,110
you want to show you one more time, what you should do every week.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,020
And the first step here would be to do the same thing.

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,090
Cause usually, uh,

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,910
as last time I showed duplicated,

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,460
Like in the previous video, I showed that you did this from draft,

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,710
Right? So you call to draft and then you a duplicate,

9
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:36,960
and this is actually a copy that I just created.

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,120
So here this one, you know,

11
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:44,520
this already. And So

12
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,470
here, let me see.

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,680
And then the next Monday we'll be 25th

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,670
And then so I'll leave it like that.

15
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,750
Hmm. And okay,

16
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:20,770
now you need to know if next week is the week we cannot.

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,330
So next one is,

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,960
uh, I think actually it is

19
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,640
right. It is. Yeah. So I will leave this to you to

20
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:37,280
feel, you already know how to goose.

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,310
Um, Yeah,

22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,610
so subject let's leave it and changed usually.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,780
So this is, um, so this is how you prepare this template.

24
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,240
So you don't change it like that for now to edit

25
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,340
design. And

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,260
So since for the next week we will have it.

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,410
So I live in here events,

28
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,470
so we can just go ahead and events.

29
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,390
And of course, if we add something new, if we announce something and then

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,730
we'll kind of come back out of it now,

31
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,730
but just in case they are kind of rating.

32
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,880
And then for the podcast, because we don't have the latest one between

33
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,670
it is not released yet. It will be released on Friday.

34
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,180
So that's why I was just this one.

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,440
So this one is kinda to do,

36
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,250
we still need to finish this, but it's almost ready.

37
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,120
So when

38
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,040
Don, we just go here and we,

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,660
this one and see, and then it's done.

40
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,050
It's ready. Yeah.

41
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,770
So this is how we create a template. So you feel in a book

42
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,560
of the week, if there is something next week,

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,430
if there is nothing, we didn't move it then events.

44
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,390
So it's really, if something,

45
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,750
we add something, then maybe one more time at the end of the week,

46
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,140
we can also be this, then podcasts,

47
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,500
this one and then add the previous

48
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,780
ones. And yeah,

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,830
that's how you create a template in the middle of the week.

50
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,040
So then during the week we can, uh,

51
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,710
could ideally populated with the content.

52
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,400
Okay. So have please change this.

53
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,920
Please modify book of the week. So now,

54
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,850
so now for you to edit this,

55
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,470
you will go to campaigns and this will be the campaign.

56
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:10,240
I just created this one and you can edit

57
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,460
this by the first one, your next time,

58
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,800
create a copy.

59
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,280
Now you can just immediately hated the copy.

60
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:21,700
And during the week you can come back and repeat it in the design.

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,470
Of course I forgot to respond to this also important.

62
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,800
Yeah. So this is how you prepare templates that we populate.

63
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,630
It's important not to send this. So yeah,

64
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,770
it saved. I'll send you all this.
