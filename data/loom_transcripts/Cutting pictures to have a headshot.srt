1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,420
Yeah. So this email looks suspicious. You probably saw this as well.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,030
So what I want to show you a score, a,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,500
um, cut, no pictures in this picture.

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:14,650
See, it's not like a head shot it's uh,

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,100
so we're in slipped on the, in the, uh,

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,260
this part here. And so I want to show you how I

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,240
do this, but feel free to use any other week

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,490
opportunities, anything. So now I say the image I open

9
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:38,250
into with, uh, I use XMU,

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:38,880
but

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,280
then Nixon, you, you,

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,810
um, so you can select a,

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,540
like a square and you see, uh,

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,820
it shows here this ice office.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,980
So just make sure that it is square.

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,760
And then because there are guidelines you can so that,

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,660
uh, to make sure that the face is in the center.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,670
Yeah, it should be some 400 by 400 is fine.

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,600
Uh, uh, you know, maybe for this bedroom.

20
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,420
And then, uh, the next thing I do is a leap,

21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,850
uh, first shift X,

22
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,520
then we have a center space and then I do a contrast

23
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:37,570
shift test to save it MPI it's,

24
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:38,410
uh, Japan,

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,990
and then I save it. So now we have a head shot,

26
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,130
not the rest of the picture.
