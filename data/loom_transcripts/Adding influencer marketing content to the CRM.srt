00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,280
Hi. Yeah, I wanted to show you another example of,

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,360
uh, sponsored content. So this content is actually,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,400
um, so Santiago is,

4
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:11,600
um, it's called Influencer Marketing.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,560
So he, they paid him to,

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,120
I assume they paid him because this is like a company,

7
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:21,400
right? So this is, um, a workshop and he's promoting,

8
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:24,440
so I assume they paid Santiago to do this.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,360
Um, so this is the company Abacos ai,

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,490
so I think I already added them.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,090
Um, yeah, influencer marketing.

12
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:38,170
See, so this is, um, let me open it here.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,170
So this is the name of the event,

14
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:46,250
right? And then this is a link to the tweet to Santiago's

15
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:49,170
post on social media, right? Then,

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,320
um, sort of then,

17
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:54,520
yeah, that type is event source influencer marketing.

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,410
So this is not a paid in the sense that sometimes when

19
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:02,250
you, I don't know if he used Twitter sometimes,

20
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:04,770
let me just open, uh, my home feed.

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,850
So on Twitter there is, um,

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,340
inorganic promotion. So if I scroll,

23
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,980
Yeah, you see this is promoted content,

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,300
right? Sometimes some of this content is also relevant for us for later talk

25
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:20,780
club. Um, so this is like,

26
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,660
uh, paid promotion, but here they didn't pay Twitter.

27
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:27,780
They paid Sango to post it,

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,020
um, to post it on his,

29
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,540
um, in his Twitter account,

30
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,060
right? So then it's influencer marketing.

31
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:39,460
So relevancy, again, medium. I already add a ba ai and then,

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,060
uh, yeah, I didn't put any comments here,

33
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,780
so I sometimes may send you, Okay,

34
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:48,260
look, this influencer is promoting this company,

35
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:50,620
and then you can just add link here.

36
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,300
Yeah, that's how you add, uh,

37
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,860
influencer marketing content to,

38
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,940
to this serum.
