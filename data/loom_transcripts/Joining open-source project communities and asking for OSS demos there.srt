00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,050
Hi. So I asked you to find somebody to do open source spotlight with

2
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:09,050
this company, Milano. So this is the GitHub Neuro,

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,210
and then actually in this GitHub, when scrolling down,

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,290
I saw that they have a Slack community. So sometimes they have Slack communities.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,610
Some of the companies have Thisor community.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,050
This is pretty similar. If you haven't used Thisor,

7
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:26,610
maybe I can show, I can record another separate video for that.

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,210
But what I, so I saw that they have a Slack community,

9
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:33,330
so I just joined this. So I clicked on this thing and then I

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,610
registered it in Slack. You have done this multiple times?

11
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:39,130
I think so. I am in their slack already.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,010
And what I want to do in, now, instead of going through list of

13
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:46,570
committers, I just want to ask that in Slack.

14
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,530
So I want to say, so that they have this introductions channel,

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,410
I think most of the, um,

16
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:57,210
most of, um, Slacks, Slack communities have this introduction channel.

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,210
So here we say a few words about,

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,370
um, like people who join, we say a few words about ourselves.

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,250
So now I will type something and then you'll see it.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,570
Okay. So I just put this on post and then type this message.

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,010
So, hi everyone, my name is um, [Inaudible],

22
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,650
myself, and then you can write. So my name is Francis and I'm a

23
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:21,210
community manager at Data Doc Club. And you can say we recently run across

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,490
company name and it looks really cool.

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,690
So I was wondering if you'd be interested in them in the project for

26
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:31,410
our community members. And then,

27
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:35,010
yeah, I wanted to add a link to our YouTube channel,

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,210
um, Open Source Spotlight playlist.

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,610
So we have this playlist where is open

30
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:46,810
source spotlight? Can see, Oh,

31
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:49,650
here it is, right? So this is the open source spotlight playlist.

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,290
So I just copied and past it here.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,750
So something like that. Yeah,

34
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,270
actually, I don't know if it's appropriate. I'll see companies say like how they

35
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,030
react to this because it's like, uh, instead of,

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,950
so previously the way we are doing, we were doing this,

37
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:26,790
we were finding people from this company and contacting this,

38
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,830
but here we are asking the open, Hey, who from you want to do

39
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:33,630
a demo, right? Mm. Yeah.

40
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,670
I think that they should not mind.

41
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,990
Let's see. But um, yeah,

42
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,150
in general, this is another approach.

43
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:44,390
And or for finding speakers for specific products,

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,190
uh, for open source spotlight. Yeah,

45
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:49,990
that's it. Oh yeah, of course I need to send it.

46
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,590
Okay.
