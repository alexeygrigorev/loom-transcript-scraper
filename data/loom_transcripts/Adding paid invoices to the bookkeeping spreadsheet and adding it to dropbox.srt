1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,870
Um, so yeah, because mines the be paid for the invoice.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,990
I wanted to show you how we include the invoices here.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,990
So, um, I will open

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:12,990
<v 1>Our,

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,430
Um, paperwork. We have this invoices income.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,080
And so let me actually open

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,000
is where its, so we opened this payment document,

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,320
uh yeah, this document, right? Let,

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,960
actually start from maybe I did it too fast.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,780
So yeah, we, yeah,

11
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:46,460
I think it might click on this thing on the invoice.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,180
I will go directly to invoice, right? So this is the invoice.

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,900
I can just click to you PDF and this is what actually we send

14
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,020
to Costa. Alternatively, we can just,

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,030
uh, uh, alternatively,

16
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:04,070
we can just, uh, so this is the same invoice,

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,520
right? So we can just get this one.

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,300
Uh, this is the invoice we sent and we put it here and

19
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:17,900
then the pattern is plus here then.

20
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,340
Uh, so this is the date.

21
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,260
So it should be 20 22, 9 90.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,380
And then today is, uh,

23
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,180
nine. So this is the day when,

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,700
um, we receive the payment. So today and uh,

25
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:39,580
yeah, so this part is not really needed. So that part was for them

26
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:43,940
to understand, uh, what they are paying for for us is just mine.

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,080
So the, the, the company,

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,030
so this is, and now we need to also add this to the,

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,430
um, to this bookkeeping.

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,150
So here, let me add,

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,990
so this is today, then this line would be when

32
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,950
we created the invoice date on this one.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,010
<v 1>So

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,290
Use a different format.

35
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,680
So this is the issue date. This is the date when it was paid,

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,960
then mine's D

37
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,120
okay. And then how we take this hands workshop

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,460
and then it's plus 4,000.

39
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,430
<v 1>Okay.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,270
So this is how we add the payments when we get paid.

41
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,280
So yeah, it's very important. Declare, declare this still in the,

42
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,050
in this bookkeeping. Yeah.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,910
How we declare please received

44
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,150
the payment

45
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,980
install and uh, up with you and see if you will receive

46
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,840
any notifications. Oh,

47
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:30,460
but yeah. So this is how we, uh,

48
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,260
add this, uh, income for bookkeeping.
