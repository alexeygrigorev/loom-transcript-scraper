1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,940
Yeah. So I wanted to show you the thing,

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:07,200
the video, I just sent you the zoom link and it's on recording.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,920
Um, if you go there, you see that there are chat messages.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:17,190
There are some places where we need to edit them and

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:21,270
you see that, uh, there was, uh, around four minutes,

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,670
52 seconds, and then around 20 minutes.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,240
So only YouTube. When you walk the video on YouTube,

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,520
you probably know that not only you can remove beginning

9
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,280
of event, but also things in the middle.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,450
So yeah, please checks the, these timestamps and,

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,040
uh, pretty much remove some parts from there.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,370
So if you're not certain about some of the things,

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,060
just let me know, but he, so for future videos,

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,120
I will just try it in chat that edit.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,370
And if you see the chat messages too,

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,730
you can check and see that they require somebody to.
