1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,060
Oh, it could be the board podcast. So podcast is,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,960
I think that we'll have data pub.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,260
We've got this inquiries podcast podcast.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,910
So the podcast published to apple podcast,

5
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:19,380
Spotify and other platforms. So there is quite a bunch of platforms where we

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:23,160
publish, and this is audio on diversion.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,990
If I click here,

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,350
<v 1>We're not making money in.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,080
We're trying to figure the is not video.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,740
And there is a video on diversion if I go to YouTube.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,670
So this is a with Greg,

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,610
I can find it here. This is one of the last,

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,290
uh, last year, this one do welcome to our event

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,240
<v 1>Available to us

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,020
Podcast. So we published last week. So see that there are no time codes

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,250
it's already on the platform. So I want to show you,

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,730
um, not the entire process, but some of the process.

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,350
So, um,

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,940
so the process, yes, your  and

20
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,280
the actual event, the podcast event happens.

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,680
Usually it is on Friday, could be other date.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,090
So then we streamed YouTube. And this is the video that you just saw

23
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,240
this video with Greg. So it was themed life.

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,630
Welcome to say it was  life,

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,730
uh, on January 21.

26
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,650
Yeah, but it's usually a bit of a delay between it is themed and

27
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:41,130
it is published on a podcast as a podcast,

28
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:44,730
as an audio on leadership. I felt this actually in the schedule.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,340
So we see it. It was a live podcast was on 21st of January.

30
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,280
And then, so this column,

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,470
uh, this bunch of columns is, or where we publish this as audio

32
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,250
only version.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,360
And we publish this 4th of February.

34
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,920
So there are there's two weeks delay between when it goes live.

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,000
And when it is published as audio, only because after that,

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,310
we need to do a bunch of things.

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,610
So that's why we need this delayed, well cut in the beginning,

38
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:19,650
you probably saw it's the easiest part.

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,420
Doesn't take very much time, but then I sent this video to a freelancer

40
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,550
and the freelancer transcribes it.

41
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:31,230
So it turns, want into text. And then what he sends is something

42
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:35,190
like this. So this is the video I want to applaud right now.

43
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:38,700
So there's a video from Lindsey about career coaching.

44
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,370
So he sends a document that looks like that.

45
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,640
And so this is a transcription,

46
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,580
and then now I need to put this transcription to the website.

47
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,130
So this is that transcript. So I need to turn this document into,

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,610
uh, this also from this document,

49
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,820
I see that the 10 quotes for each phrase,

50
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,270
we have, uh, a timestamp when this occurs.

51
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,010
So because there are others like for each kind of block or section,

52
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,980
and the freelancer also, uh,

53
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,760
use the name of the section so we can extract 10 quotes.

54
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,040
So this is a skier,

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,830
the title. And then after the title,

56
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,160
there is a timestamp. So what I do, I have a script that there

57
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,710
are a, that does this automatically.

58
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,950
And for now I will need to do this,

59
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,680
I guess, but then I will also need to pick it out how you

60
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,050
can help me with that without,

61
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,330
um, Kevin, around this, uh,

62
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,250
without, uh, yeah, maybe I can put this online somewhere so you can just

63
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:45,850
upload this file and get this.

64
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,120
Okay. Yeah. So you don't need to document what I'm saying now.

65
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,820
It's more like for you to understand the process.

66
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,490
Okay. So we have this document and the next

67
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,450
step is at the same time, extend that to the editors.

68
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,130
And this happens to the Dropbox. I think I just shared a access video.

69
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,700
It's in my Dropbox, they have this custom folder.

70
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,470
And then after the event, what I do is I create a folder with

71
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,520
the date timestamp when, uh,

72
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,570
the podcast was themed life. And I bought,

73
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,350
uh, the files there. I do this because they are on my computer.

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,950
I don't think you will be able to do this. Um,

75
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,920
yeah. And then there's this folder called edited and yeah,

76
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:40,480
I need to move. So this, uh, so the editors who take care of

77
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,500
editing the podcast, they would in this podcast folder.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,290
And then, because they're one with Greg,

79
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,100
I uploaded one. We could go, I need to put this two uploaded folder.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,670
And now there is this podcast with, uh,

81
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,820
uh, Lindsey. So it is already edited.

82
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,370
So if I open it, there is some

83
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,670
already. So, uh, I will need to upload this.

84
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,950
So first. Yeah. So these two things actually happened in parallel.

85
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,340
So I sent the video to a freelancer and then the next week he

86
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,380
usually gets back with a transcription and then I sent this

87
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:27,610
to the editor and then they also get back next week,

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,270
the app for the file to this folder.

89
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,140
And then also from this time scripts,

90
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,620
now I want to extract 10 calls. Um,

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,170
but to be done, Lord this again,

92
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,000
you do not need to, uh, during the scene to your

93
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:49,510
process document, because I don't think you will have to do this.

94
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,840
So maybe some of these parts,

95
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:57,190
but not in this form. So I got the document.

96
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,090
This is a doc document. I'll just rename it to say Lindsey.

97
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,020
Then I have a script that, and

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,330
I don't know, where did it go? Okay.

99
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,880
Yeah. So good to hear, um,

100
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,100
that term, this dockings document into a format that they can use.

101
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,560
So I know that leaves in download and then let's

102
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:32,270
see. Yeah. So this clip now we'll extract time codes and then

103
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:36,800
create two. So I need to say where the results

104
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:41,360
should go. So it will go to TMP slash results

105
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,230
again, do you see what it does it, first of all,

106
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:47,780
creates this file, open it.

107
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,950
This is just for your information again. So that is all team result,

108
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,950
but this is the file card. It looks like.

109
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,530
So this is something that we'll use for the website and it also

110
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,190
puts the timecards. So I need to take this one in

111
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:14,930
copilot to YouTube, you

112
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:18,530
to then find the video for which this transcript was created.

113
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,650
Some video with an engineer,

114
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,560
click edit video.

115
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,120
I think I need to follow up with her because she sent me some

116
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:35,600
links to center things,

117
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,650
but here, I want to show you that I need to insert of time

118
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:44,510
quotes. So these are the 10 quotes and the essay leader talked

119
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,090
about. And then,

120
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,950
yeah, I just copy the time course here. And then yeah,

121
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,020
let me just in case at, uh,

122
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,060
LinkedIn

123
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,580
nicotine. So we

124
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:12,310
made sure it properly spoke your name. Say

125
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,600
then I think she sent me a link that I needed to include this

126
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:22,330
and I forgot. Um,

127
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,240
yeah. Imposter.

128
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,440
Okay. Yeah. So these are the links, um,

129
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,640
here, is that the timestamps?

130
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,370
Okay. Yeah. Let me just save it.

131
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,630
Now, if I go back to the video, I studied

132
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:02,070
engineering. You see that we have a time course right now we have this

133
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:04,830
chapters and we can jump,

134
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,270
jump from one to another.

135
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,700
No. So now we are done with time codes and they want to show

136
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:17,850
you how to upload videos to Concord.

137
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,120
So go to the anchor and

138
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:27,380
I click on new episode. I think I applaud this.

139
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,340
Um, ideally this would happen not on the day.

140
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,550
So right now it's Friday on Friday. I usually publish them.

141
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,620
So ideally I should do this immediately after,

142
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,400
uh, it is edited. So no.

143
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:55,860
Yeah. And then I go to Dropbox,

144
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,370
Dropbox, I'm in Dropbox and then edited.

145
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,310
And this is the episode Lindsay.

146
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,600
So click on this. Um,

147
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,730
and then the title and I just copy from here.

148
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,400
Now, this is the title. And then since we already have,

149
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,060
uh, uh, time quotes, the chapter names,

150
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,540
I also we'll put it here. So I'll say that we talk about,

151
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,540
and then this will be a list of things we talked about.

152
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:37,320
Let me copy this. So we'll go to a text editor and

153
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,300
I have a little more this time codes. Sometimes seeing the time codes.

154
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,160
There is another one let's say I'm prepping up,

155
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,010
which I also remove if it's there.

156
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,660
And then so in vs code,

157
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:58,560
I can like all these things at the same time.

158
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,200
Okay. If you use like the usual notepad,

159
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,520
you can remove them one by one like that to

160
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,750
be vs quote on windows.

161
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,360
I just need to press control then down

162
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,110
to a one course or in multiple lines.

163
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,410
And then I select this, I just did it.

164
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,370
So now I take this text without the time,

165
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,440
uh, timestamps, I take it and paste

166
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:40,710
it to Ortiz to anchor it

167
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,270
and then add links here. So these are the links that,

168
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,790
uh, uh, uh,

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,190
sense some of these links should already be in a YouTube

170
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,530
video

171
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,160
put down. It should also be like,

172
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:04,030
at least. So now you see when I do control V it basic like

173
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:08,410
in one line. So of course it can, it's like this.

174
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,440
What I usually do is I do control shift.

175
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,760
So then it sorts it like that. I still need to edit it a

176
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:16,270
little bit.

177
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,350
And finally, I also take these two things and

178
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,000
put them at . So

179
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:35,590
I'm, this is the format. So first we talked about coma,

180
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,570
then line break. Then this is a bulleted list

181
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,550
with things we talked about, then links that speaker sense.

182
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,790
Also bulleted list in this too.

183
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,980
And yeah, the publication date is Friday.

184
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,560
So we'll have this. Yeah,

185
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,000
I have it here. So I think repeat this here too.

186
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,180
Yeah. So this should be today.

187
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,630
And then CSUN is the same as previous and then three,

188
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,860
this would be for say, so this one is season seven,

189
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,850
episode four, published on 11 February books

190
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,790
here to anchor. So I select 11 and then it should be 7:00 PM

191
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,320
central European time. So for your, probably to be a different time.

192
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:48,340
So it's 7:00 PM central European time click confirm and

193
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,310
season number. And this is from here.

194
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,460
So seven and then,

195
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,680
um, yes, right now I don't, uh,

196
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,260
I'll probably record a separate video later to have it

197
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,750
be so dark right now we can just leave it like that.

198
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,770
Don't think I need to do anything else.

199
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,940
So it's five, right? No, it's four.

200
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,890
It is four. Yeah.

201
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,750
And I click schedule and

202
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:32,680
then a forgot to results. They should see that.

203
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,360
Yeah. This episode about career coaching with Lindsay is scheduled for

204
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,320
today. And then ideally,

205
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,650
as I said, the moment the pilot is here.

206
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,770
We should go ahead and put this on,

207
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,430
uh, end core and scheduled and what we might not

208
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:55,640
have. So maybe this, um, the editor,

209
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:57,790
our pastor, and we don't have, uh,

210
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,250
at the time codes yet, we still go here,

211
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,740
click on new episode, we upload the file,

212
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,910
which has gone there. We talked about section and we put the links with,

213
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,090
uh, uh, yeah, the link sometime with ScaleIO,

214
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,740
which has don't have, um, uh,

215
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,590
we talked about section and we add this later into it this later.

216
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,190
Yeah. You can just click on this then.

217
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,020
Is this the edit button? And we add these things

218
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:32,480
here. I think I even might have this call

219
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:37,160
to edit podcasts. I don't remember if I recorded

220
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:37,550
this.

221
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,200
Um, yeah. I don't know. Maybe you saw this all today.

222
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,910
Hey. Yeah.

223
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,300
It's we don't need to it because we don't change it.

224
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,680
Yeah. This is how we schedule, um,

225
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,680
podcast episodes with inquiry.

226
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,660
And then what I will need to do now is after this episode

227
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,200
is scheduled for me to,

228
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,720
uh, to create this page here,

229
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,600
podcast page, it's a little bit technical so far now,

230
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,240
uh, you will probably not need to do this.

231
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:31,520
Maybe I will create some form that you will need to,

232
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,130
um, if you in, and then I will execute your comments on

233
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,980
my end to make it easier for me to generate it.

234
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,760
But for now, this is what you need to do.

235
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,200
So this are your videos to Encore and

236
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,300
yeah, it's all.
