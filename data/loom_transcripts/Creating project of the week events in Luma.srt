1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,360
Hi. So I wanted to talk about creating events with Luma,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,240
and we use Luma for this new re relatively new initiative called

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,200
Project of the Week. So for Project of the week,

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,680
we, um, let me open it,

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,160
uh,

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,040
<v 1>Project

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,440
Of the Week. So this is the main repository for this initiative project of

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:26,720
the week. And we have different projects here.

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,920
So this one per Recommend systems was project of the week that you saw

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,480
last time when I was showing you how to edit some stuff in Luma.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,640
Um, and yeah, like we have,

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,560
uh, so this is an event that goes,

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,960
uh, that takes like it's,

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,600
it's couple of days. It takes a couple of days. You see that there

15
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:52,920
is a range of dates from one day to another.

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,080
And then there is this link sign up here,

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,440
which leads to Lua. And then if we go through this,

18
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,920
there is a plan for each of the days, like day one,

19
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:07,000
day two, day three, and so on.

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,080
And we plan to have another one.

21
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:13,760
So this one was already created by me some time ago.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,400
And then there is another one, which is now work in progress.

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,280
Uh, this one. And,

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,160
uh, yeah, this part that I show is maybe not important because the link

25
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:30,800
will, that we will create in Lua will point here,

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,680
right? Uh, but right now, since it's a work in progress,

27
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,760
it's in this repository. So for a second you can pretend

28
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:42,960
that this is my, this is our re this one,

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,640
this is the repo, but right now it's just,

30
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,760
um, a copy of the repo created by Liana.

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,720
Okay, So this is the project she created already.

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,880
So this is, um, so there are like five

33
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:00,040
days starting from day zero,

34
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,280
16th of November, uh,

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,160
17, 18, 19th, uh,

36
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,400
of November. Um,

37
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:11,720
and so now we want to create an event in Luma for all of

38
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,880
these dates, right? So this is, um,

39
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:16,040
these are the dates to,

40
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,800
yeah, it actually takes a little bit more.

41
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,560
That's for a week. I don't know why the dates are like that,

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,480
but okay. So now let us create events,

43
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,080
uh, an event with multiple days in Luma using this one.

44
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:38,160
And again, pretend that this is not, uh, that this is actually this

45
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:42,120
path, right? So this is, this will be the path for this thing.

46
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,600
Once, uh, we finish working on this,

47
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,720
this will be the path. Um,

48
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,000
yeah, so,

49
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,960
uh, let me go to, uh,

50
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:00,480
Luma. So go to are on the

51
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:05,760
main page and then here I will just click on create an

52
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,000
event

53
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,920
and change cover photo.

54
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,120
So for the photo, um,

55
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,040
I will just save this one.

56
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,680
So this is the previous one. I will just reuse it.

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,140
How can I save the image?

58
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,440
Actually that's weird.

59
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,880
So it's not saveable or what?

60
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,280
<v 1>Mm.

61
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,440
So for this case, when uh, an image is not saveable,

62
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,080
uh, what I do is I go here to inspect

63
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,240
and then see, yeah, this is the background url.

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,520
Click on this, copy it.

65
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:00,550
<v 1>Hmm,

66
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,100
Move this thing.

67
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,300
<v 1>Okay, Yeah.

68
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,220
Hmm. That's weird. I guess you can just save this image once.

69
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,700
And we are basically using the same image every time.

70
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,620
Uh, project,

71
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,000
project. Or I can just send you this image if you don't want to

72
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,520
go through this. So that's the same image.

73
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:32,400
So now let me change this. Ah,

74
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,160
it's already here. So I can just click here.

75
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:38,720
I don't know if you will have it or not. And then the name.

76
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,840
So you see how the name is here.

77
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,760
So this project of the week, um,

78
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:48,880
colon and then the name of the project. So the name of the project

79
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:52,680
here is this one, Recommendation System part two.

80
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,160
So d i i y live out keep on the recommendation system.

81
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,120
Um, part two. So this will be a virtual event.

82
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,920
So the event euro, you can see here,

83
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,680
this is the project of Week channel in Slack.

84
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,360
So just copy this link under address and put it here.

85
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,000
And then it's an event series. So the duration will be,

86
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,360
let's say 30. Oh, it's zero hours,

87
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,240
I'll put it to 30 minutes. Cause these events are not really events.

88
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,880
They are more like reminders for people to go to Slack.

89
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,800
And then let's, uh, let me,

90
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,840
Uh, let me make them at five

91
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:46,400
30. Move this one now.

92
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,800
So they, they start at 16th,

93
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,560
right? So 16th will be the first one.

94
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,160
Then I add second one,

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,920
third. Uh, how many do we have here till Sunday?

96
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:05,480
Right? So for now let's just create five of them.

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,840
But then you see it's quite simple to,

98
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,120
to just, you know, session. Then you edit what

99
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:13,680
is it actually?

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
<v 1><silence>

101
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:20,360
Maybe I can just do something like that.

102
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:26,280
Let me see. So when the daily

103
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:30,440
number of days five, Yeah,

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,280
<laugh>, it was actually the same thing, right?

105
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,640
Okay. You can see how easy it is to add.

106
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,280
Anyways, um, what else?

107
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,400
I think that's for now.

108
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,080
That's it, right?

109
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,560
So now let me just create event. So in event is created now

110
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,560
go to hosts at Host,

111
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,640
and then I will add you here.

112
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:02,240
So you will probably need to add me. So the role is host can

113
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:04,720
Managements, right? So that's you.

114
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,200
So now you should be able to, to change this

115
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,320
thing. Hopefully we haven't tested it yet.

116
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,240
So now let's see. I will go now to details and I will

117
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,840
update the details. So here's the description.

118
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,960
And you see this is the description we had here.

119
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,360
So I will copy it and I will paste

120
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:30,480
this. So this is the description,

121
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,400
first part, this is the description about,

122
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,000
um, the actual, you know,

123
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,400
the project of week, what it is this week will,

124
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,720
uh, continue learning about Commander Systems because

125
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:48,480
it's part two. That's why I continue. Otherwise it will be we'll learn about.

126
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,680
And then this will be the topic.

127
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,320
Read more about it here. So we need to

128
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,960
Change it slightly because the link will be,

129
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
remember I showed you, Um,

130
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,840
yeah, this will be the link.

131
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,480
<v 1>Okay.

132
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:12,120
Edit. And then public euro. Public euro is the,

133
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:16,760
we have this, the euro here and I will just

134
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:20,280
put it here. So it's DDC project of the week,

135
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:23,640
and then the code name for the project. So because we already had the

136
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:25,760
access one. So this one is access two.

137
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,060
Okay. Uh,

138
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,940
I think here that's all we need to do.

139
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:39,640
So we don't tick this one Access.

140
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,560
Um,

141
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,180
<v 1>Yeah,

142
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,900
That's a part of this project of the we community.

143
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,340
Then, yeah, it's free except registration.

144
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:56,680
Max Capacity, not, don't,

145
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,880
we don't need to enforce emails.

146
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,040
Um, yeah. So this is the thing I showed you already.

147
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,160
So for this one, we remove this one,

148
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,000
We remove the first one and we remove the,

149
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:19,040
the last one. And we,

150
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,120
What did I show you last time? I don't remember.

151
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,440
So let me quickly check how it looked.

152
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,160
It's probably saved somewhere.

153
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,440
<v 1>Okay.

154
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,990
Okay. I'll just go to some of our previous events.

155
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,630
Uh, past, yeah, past event manage.

156
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,790
Just want to see how emails look like.

157
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,390
So it was daily reminder, a reminder to join.

158
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,470
So let me copy this part.

159
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,870
So we have the emoji here.

160
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:02,190
Cox, oops, I don't need it.

161
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,790
Daily. Reminder to join.

162
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,590
Uh, too many spaces here. Daily reminder to join event name

163
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,870
<v 1>My class.

164
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,630
And what did we have here in the party?

165
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,990
I have to remember,

166
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,470
<v 1>Maybe,

167
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,510
Can I actually see it?

168
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,140
Uh, email.

169
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,020
Okay. Um,

170
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:42,940
I guess we can just leave it empty. Mm, yeah,

171
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:46,340
if, and also let's change this to five 30,

172
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,540
the reminder to join.

173
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,380
<v 1>Okay,

174
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:55,980
Great reminder. And then we need to do it for

175
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,620
all these things. So remove this one.

176
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,660
The first one, remove this one and change this one.

177
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,100
So it's, uh, um,

178
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,780
daily reminder to join and it should be at five

179
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:13,220
30. Okay?

180
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,940
That's, uh, that's it. This is how you create events in

181
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,460
Luma and events for Project of the Weekend.

182
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,460
Remember project of the week, they are multiple

183
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:28,700
days events, right? So there are multiple,

184
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,180
they occur over multiple days.

185
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,780
And then maybe we will need to add, uh,

186
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,060
a couple of more sessions. Um,

187
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:41,780
by the way, just let me quickly check what else we need

188
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:41,940
to

189
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:42,780
<v 1><affirmative>

190
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,180
Add here.

191
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,300
<v 1>More,

192
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,400
I guess for now we don't need to do anything else.

193
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,920
So that's how we create events in Luma. Then I'll send

194
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,400
you this picture so you have it. Okay,

195
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,080
see you later.
