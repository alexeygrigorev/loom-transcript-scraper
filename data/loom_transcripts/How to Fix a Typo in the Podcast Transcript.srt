00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,820
Hi, so Valeria pointed out that there is a typo in the name,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,500
so I wanted to show you how to fix that.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,280
So we go to our website in GitHub repo,

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,120
which is this one, and we go to this

5
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:21,820
underscore podcast directory. And we here we find,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,580
when it loads, we find the podcast

7
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,800
episode. So for us, I think it's this one.

8
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:35,792
Other ones for everyone, right? So we go there.

9
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:43,852
And here we click on this edit as well.

10
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:53,532
And now we just need to find this and replace,

11
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:56,432
I think, yeah, here this is the transcript.

12
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:01,152
So let me check if this one is correct.

13
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:08,087
The part, let me open it.

14
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,327
So in the transcript, we usually,

15
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:17,107
like for each line, we want to show who is the speaker.

16
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:24,147
Yeah, so here there is also a mistake.

17
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,347
So it should be Miriam, not Miriam.

18
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,747
And this actually, like we can, of course,

19
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:36,107
detect this before we upload.

20
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:41,927
We can also use the transcript here, so we can ask Pavel to fix

21
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:46,927
that. But now it's kinda late. And now I want to see how we,

22
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:51,807
So right now I pressed Ctrl F and we have this

23
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:56,327
part, right? So what I want to do is to get medium

24
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:59,287
and replace it with medium.

25
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:03,187
And you see it highlights already.

26
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:10,661
I don't know why there's,

27
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:14,141
Yeah, there's also should be brackets.

28
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:22,121
But yeah, this is less important. So basically

29
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:26,541
here we can change everything in this,

30
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,661
In this document.

31
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:32,221
And all these changes that we do will be reflected in this page.

32
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,021
So basically this is the source code for that page.

33
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:37,341
And right now I will just,

34
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:39,921
Yeah, it highlights all the changes and,

35
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:44,957
I click replace all. And let's say if there was one,

36
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:49,357
One typo, right? Just one place with the mistake.

37
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:54,477
We can find this place somewhere here and just go and,

38
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:57,337
Change it. I don't know. Let's say there is a typo.

39
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:00,657
Here, Maria Magris. And then,

40
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:05,517
yeah, we change it. So this is how you find the podcast page

41
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:10,497
in our GitHub repository. This is how you edit

42
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:15,193
changes. This is how you, So, I'm going to replace typos in the

43
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:21,613
name and this is how you replace,

44
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:25,773
I don't know, maybe, let's skip it with square brackets,

45
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:30,533
this is how you just replace things in

46
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:33,513
the transcript. Now I just click commit changes,

47
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,833
like commit message, and you can just leave it like that,

48
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:42,433
and press commit, so now it updates the

49
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:47,142
page. And in a few minutes

50
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,362
this page will be updated,

51
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:54,102
when of course it actually saves.

52
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:58,182
Okay, so this is how you do this.
