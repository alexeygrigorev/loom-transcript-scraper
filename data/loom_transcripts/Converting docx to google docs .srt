1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,050
Um, I just wanted to show you what I mean by now.

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:06,810
Word document, not Google. So if you,

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,770
you see there is this w think, so it means that it's actually a

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:15,780
word document. So if I go to the directory,

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,520
uh, you see like the sexually discuss shows that this is Microsoft word format.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,610
So I want to open this, you

7
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:30,300
see that there's actually quite a bunch of word documents.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,090
Um, they take some time to open in, uh,

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,340
Google drive. So yeah,

10
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:38,820
I prefer to have like native Google docs format.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,640
So anyways, so what I asked you to do here first,

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,480
um, put the prefix deleted.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,020
So not, not just delete first,

14
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:56,610
but put the prefix, then save it as a Google

15
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:59,520
doc. So you create a copy as Google doc.

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,310
I think I put the prefix to earlier. So, uh,

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
let me put it here.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,060
Yeah. So for this one, it's kind of deleted.

19
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,840
So here created calendar invite.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,050
So now we see that it's

21
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,810
here, right? So this is like not,

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,640
it doesn't have w anymore here and now you will

23
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:31,230
need to go to Trello. And

24
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:35,850
in thrill, I think there are two carts that use this template to

25
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,940
use this process document. Sorry. Um,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,070
what has been our problem? Maybe more so please go

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,960
through these cards and replace the protest docs to point to

28
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:53,520
the new one, because they have, because they have different things.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,090
And then after that, you can just, uh,

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,370
many more mode from here. So this is what I mean by,

31
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,680
um, by doing this.

32
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,980
No. So I'll add the loom in the.
