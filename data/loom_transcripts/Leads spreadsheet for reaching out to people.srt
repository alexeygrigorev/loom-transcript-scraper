1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,170
Do you keep reaching out to people and be more organized?

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,590
I think what we can do is use the slits,

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,760
uh, stable, um,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,650
can use a spreadsheet that I just created in this schedule spreadsheet.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,220
So this is what I would send to you and say,

6
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,470
Hey, please, uh, every child,

7
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,570
and so does to do a workshop,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,940
for example. And then, um,

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,440
what it can do is take this thing here to link,

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,370
right? So then they'll have a link and then you see,

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,740
you see that this is the name of elite.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,870
So it is somebody who for,

13
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:48,750
will want to the child. And, uh, just to give a talk or I

14
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,330
don't know, do a book of the week thing.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,060
So then event type in this case is workshop and workshop and webinars

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,190
are essentially the same things.

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,870
Um, and,

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,190
um, yeah, you probably saw like the document that I sent you,

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,700
uh, that, uh, there is also this workshop and then LinkedIn,

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,900
um, so LinkedIn email,

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,840
and then maybe we can ride starters, uh,

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,170
sent a connection,

23
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:28,380
request, something like this. So then we know that,

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,960
um, yeah,

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,120
maybe we need to follow up with her.

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,090
Perhaps we need to use something like CRM,

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,670
but we're going to do this later for now.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,920
I can just go with this spreadsheet to make sure we don't

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,050
forget that.
