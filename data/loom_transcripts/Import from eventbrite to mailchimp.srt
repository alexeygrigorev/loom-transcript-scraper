1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
It's cold emails of those who registered to events and put

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:08,940
them to MailChimp. So caught you in the parade,

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,290
my events. And then this is usually pestilence

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,060
fast. Let's take this one career question.

5
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,920
The last one take on this.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,790
Then we have this attendee summary click on

7
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,060
this

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,350
and then report resolved ESE.

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,300
So usually cope with CSV. Excel, I guess works fine as well.

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,070
So then I click on this thing. I use limber office,

11
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:57,020
but I guess Microsoft Excel and do the same thing and distribute account.

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,480
So documents in Libra office then.

13
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,070
Yeah, I just click. Okay.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,390
And then I have this emails of those scored,

15
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:16,070
it just threat for the event. And some of them here,

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,400
the column is, do you want to subscribe to data talks,

17
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:23,540
newsletter and receive updates? So some people don't and that's fine,

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,150
but we want to select those who did, uh,

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,420
who do want to subscribe. So for that,

20
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:32,810
I do view, uh,

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,530
I think, yeah, data out the filter.

22
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,350
And then here, I just see that there is this dropdown list.

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,800
So then I select here I unselect.

24
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:50,360
No. So there is only yes, and I click,

25
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:56,480
okay. So we have now on get those one to subscribe and

26
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,220
now I select them sort

27
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:06,140
of controls here. Then I paste them to some editor.

28
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,400
And the important thing here is we need to check the context to identify

29
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,680
people who would not want to subscribe and here.

30
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,310
So I check the number. So here,

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,210
the total number is 52 and I have one of the 13.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,320
So it seems so key. So usually around a half one to,

33
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,980
um, subscribe, and then I go to MailChimp.

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,390
So let me start with the main page of mailchimp.com.

35
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,600
Then I click login and

36
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:43,340
then they go to your audience, this audience,

37
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,470
and then my niche audience hit import contacts.

38
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,440
So I want to copy paste.

39
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,270
And then there's just what we took from the form from the Excel

40
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,780
file. So we've heard from a bunch of females here,

41
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,910
continue to organize. And then what I do here,

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,130
subscribe then update my existing contacts and then

43
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,490
search for tax tax is event,

44
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,040
then continue to match and finalize and then complete import.

45
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,590
And then now it will say, how many, so the six new

46
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,600
contacts and 24,

47
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:34,630
or it's correct. If there are more than 100 emails

48
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:39,370
on that list, you will not see that you will see only four and

49
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:44,050
these with 100 or less, then you contact.

50
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,270
We see these people here and they

51
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:56,750
have this, a listing Burt, I think.

52
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,790
Yeah. And we can actually check if one of them it's not important to,

53
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,810
but there should be some automation on it. Now that doesn't work

54
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:12,500
yet, but there will be a mail to them saying,

55
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,540
Hey, thanks for attending your events.

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,090
Here's a link to join us.

57
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:23,180
Okay. That's all. This is how you import people from Eventbrite

58
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,810
to mail.
