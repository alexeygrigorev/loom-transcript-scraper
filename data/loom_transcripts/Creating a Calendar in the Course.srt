00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:05,215
I realized that the instructions for creating the calendar in in

2
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:09,423
the course was not clear so I probably should record the video and then

3
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:13,669
we create a process document for that so the way it usually works is

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,604
when we have something in the course calendar we create an event

5
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:23,458
and then I will go to more options where

6
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:28,201
the yeah so then here we select a calendar here so we

7
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:33,904
use this data engineering zoom camp and

8
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:38,578
we don't add guests here because this information is visible to

9
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,330
a lot of people so we don't want to share any zoom links we

10
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:47,463
don't want to share any emails we don't want to share anything except

11
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:52,005
the title so here we will have office hours we dont need

12
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:56,159
to add anything else because the calendar is that engineering zoom camp so its

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,809
kinda clear that its office hours for that and then the link

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,190
will be our youtube channel

15
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:15,068
so the link here will be our youtube channel and here we

16
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:20,763
will write we will stream 2 or

17
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:25,396
youtube channel and then the link right so and there

18
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:30,080
is nothing else so we can i guess it doesn't

19
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:34,755
matter so we don't need to change anything here so here we updated and

20
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:38,084
this is the the previous one i think yeah this is the previous one

21
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:43,838
that i changed so now for this one i

22
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:48,472
edited it and i didnt realize that we have two different so

23
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:53,504
we have only one event so please for this one recreate

24
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:58,105
it one more time so this so for this event

25
00:01:58,106 --> 00:02:02,987
i'll delete it so please create it one more time using the usual

26
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:07,670
way of doing that and when we need to create a course

27
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:11,334
event you know now how to do this so for that for the event

28
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:12,441
