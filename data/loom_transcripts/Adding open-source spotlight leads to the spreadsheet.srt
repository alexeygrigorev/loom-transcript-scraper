1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,290
And I forgot one thing about that.

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,960
So I did send email to, uh,

3
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:09,300
Yannis, excuse me a minute.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,940
So this one at the end is, and what we also need to do

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:18,570
is now add him as a lead here.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,810
Um, uh,

7
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:23,190
so this will be the link

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,490
name, uh, good place.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,140
Um, LinkedIn, we don't know. Well,

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,430
I think there was his LinkedIn actually right now.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,440
Mail, email,

12
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,240
email.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,910
Yeah. So this is how we add this,

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,700
um, people who would reach out to,

15
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,150
to open source qualified leads.
