1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,360
Hi. So you see this invoice from pal.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,240
All right. So I wanted to show you how to pay for these invoices.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,320
So first of all, we need to forward this invoice to the invoice

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,400
attachment and, um,

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,000
edit subject name to, um,

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,440
transcription. Cause this is what we do,

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,840
transcription of QA, a sessions.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,040
Um, so you see this invoice will appear in Dropbox with

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,600
this name transcription and it'll have today's date.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,970
So I will send it right now. So that's the first step.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,530
And then I will go to phenom and then,

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,730
ah, yeah, it's in German for me,

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,050
but you probably know like for you, it probably appears in English.

14
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,730
So now I need to sign up to sign in.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:55,990
<v 1>Okay.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,990
So let me type in the quote.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,030
<v 1>Um,

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,070
So I received a quote on,

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,480
uh, mobile phone. You probably also have this and

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,040
we, I need to do a new payment.

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,940
So the invoice was for,

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,060
<v 1>Um,

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,980
100 7170,

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,940
and then here, we already know,

25
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,720
so this is pav. So let me just make sure that the

26
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,120
IBAN the bank account name is correct one.

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,890
Yeah, it is still the same still the same.

28
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,890
And then here, we also mention the invoice or is the

29
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:47,010
invoice in the invoice number?

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,920
Yeah. And now, so it's 170 net review payment.

31
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:55,720
<v 1>Um,

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,480
Yeah. Looks legit looks right.

33
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,120
Um, you know, and for you,

34
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:07,200
it'll probably look different. So for you,

35
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:11,840
when you do something like this, I will have to confirm now

36
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,640
we will see how it works. Actually. I don't know. So

37
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,280
I am confirming this.

38
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,700
<v 1>Okay. Now

39
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:31,700
Something is wrong with, with my up just a second.

40
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay. Now I confirm.

41
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,620
<v 1>Um,

42
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,090
Yeah. And, uh, that's it,

43
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:54,110
I guess, so,

44
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,770
<v 1>Uh,

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,970
Payment download PDF,

46
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,180
um, maybe,

47
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:12,490
uh, what we can do now is download this thing or

48
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,730
maybe I will just make a screenshot of this thing

49
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,950
and, um, could be also like you can just download a PDF and send

50
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:30,110
it. I just screenshot.

51
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,050
Thank you, pav. The invoice is

52
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,040
great. I actually don't know.

53
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,530
Um, so for you,

54
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:44,770
because you might actually need to,

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,250
uh, wait till I confirm it, so maybe we will need to change the

56
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:52,610
process document later, but, um,

57
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,610
for now we can document it this way and then we will see how

58
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,450
exactly, um, it'll look like.

59
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,690
Okay. And I think I just signed it and

60
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,890
by the way, I want to confirm that we have it in Dropbox.

61
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,160
So I go to invoices and then

62
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,720
we have it here

63
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,710
transcription. So we'll have the document and then we

64
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,990
will need to go to, um,

65
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,310
<v 1>Bookkeeping.

66
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:43,310
Right. And then we will need to update

67
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:45,590
it. Uh, yeah, where it is.

68
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,670
So we need to update it here and you already know how to do

69
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:52,860
this. So with pav it's,

70
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,620
uh, we'll copy it here. So it's just transcriptions without

71
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:00,000
articles. Mm.

72
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,280
And then we need to fill this in.

73
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,720
So yeah, maybe for that one, you can do it later.

74
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,240
Um, when you see this video,

75
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:15,600
you can do it. Um, so here you would need to like,

76
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:20,160
let me just do this since I'm here. So it's minus 170 and for

77
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:24,440
this one, uh, please do it. Okay.

78
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:29,360
That's uh, that's how we do it. So this is how we pay invoices.
