1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,070
So we, we received the payment, we received the payment from SDB.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,510
So I just throw it to cost. You probably saw this cost.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,790
Yeah. So just saw that we, the payment,

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,630
this is something you also do.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,270
I actually don't know if you see this, if you get some sort of

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,880
where notification, uh, yeah.

7
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:29,320
Maybe we can actually, uh, make sure you get some email when we get

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,440
a payment anyways. Uh,

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,680
yeah. So this is the payment,

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,800
but it's not linked to an invoice.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,560
So actually there, there should be some sort of link.

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,360
They did not include any,

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,520
they didn't include invoice ad. That's why it wasn't automatically linked.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,190
Uh, usually it is linked. So for example,

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,790
um, let's take this one. So the one from infrastructure lines.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,110
So they marked in invoice here.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,430
So there was like it automatically attached to document invoice.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,150
So it knew that the invoice, uh,

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,950
was paid. So here we need to do this manually.

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,820
I'll show you how to do this. Um,

21
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:16,660
yeah, so go to this payment and then attach document,

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,500
and then we just select one of the invoices.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,650
So this one, mines DB, Inc.

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,810
So yeah, this is how we attach the invoice.

25
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:35,300
And now we know that this invoice was actually paid you

26
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,860
that's here invoice.

27
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,780
So now that's how

28
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:45,220
you attach invoices to payments.
