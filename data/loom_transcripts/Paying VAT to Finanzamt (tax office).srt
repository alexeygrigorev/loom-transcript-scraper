00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,150
Hi. So I received this email from our,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,630
um, tax consultants, from the accountants and this email,

3
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:13,190
yeah, it's in Russian or it's actually like a mixture of Russian

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,990
and uh, German. So let me translate it in English.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,040
Um,

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,560
<v 1>Okay,

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,680
This is Russian, right? Um,

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,600
yeah. So I will probably in the future will forward these emails to

9
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,200
you. Um, yeah,

10
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,480
I see that, uh, Google does not,

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,720
uh, translate the there German part.

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,360
Anyways, so this thing is about V A T.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,920
So I need to pay V a T every quarter.

14
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,560
Sometimes, um, the tax office returns,

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,040
VT gives, uh, back v t.

16
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,560
Sometimes I need to pay vt. So in this month I need to pay

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,240
v t and I want to show you how to do this.

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,000
So this is the e email and I think this is the document we

19
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,280
need to add to,

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,350
um, you know, our, um,

21
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,430
booking. So we'll forward it right now.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,890
So we'll write something like,

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,530
um, uh, VT here and uh,

24
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:27,810
like exactly how we, um,

25
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,250
like the exact line you can check in the previous,

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,890
uh, you can check in

27
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:37,650
the previous, uh, months how we put it.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,150
I think it was, uh,

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,890
this one. Yeah. Oh, oh, fin sum and then v a t.

30
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:52,890
And then this is, uh, for this one it would be four Q,

31
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:55,410
like four quarter 2022.

32
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,810
And then, then it's negative, right?

33
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,450
So it's mean minus something and fine sum in,

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,610
uh, German fin sum means,

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,410
uh, the tax office. So we need to write fin and sum and then

36
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:08,690
V 80 here and then the quarter,

37
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,570
and then include the, the thing here.

38
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,490
So here it'll be a minus.

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,770
And uh, as you see here in this document,

40
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,450
the, there is no, um, bank details.

41
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,490
So let me just first, uh,

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:25,970
<v 1>Send

43
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:28,700
It here, right?

44
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:31,020
And then we keep only this one,

45
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,540
right? So this, this U S T,

46
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,340
um, which is ZA store in German,

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,740
which means V 80, right?

48
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,940
When you see U S T, it means V 80. Okay,

49
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,220
so I'm sending it here.

50
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,620
So we'll have it now in Dropbox and our books.

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,180
And now we will need to actually pay this amount.

52
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:55,500
So I'll show you how to pay it to this finan sound.

53
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,780
So go to fin. So put the,

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,560
um, total here and then here now I look for finance

55
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,040
ump. So this is, this is it.

56
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,120
And I will also need to put reason for payment.

57
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,240
Um, okay,

58
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,360
that's interesting. Where do I find it?

59
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,920
Um, probably need to check the previous

60
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:28,160
one. So let me, let me see the previous transactions.

61
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,160
So now you will create a process document for that,

62
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:38,040
and then you will write it down. So we don't need to,

63
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,850
um, to look it up every time. Finance out the,

64
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,930
in September, uh, we pay them 300 and

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,210
yeah, so this is how it should be.

66
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:56,090
So this is my tax number, tax 80.

67
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,490
And this is, um, I don't know what PJ means.

68
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,610
I think this is like, uh,

69
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:05,210
it should be fourth quarter 22,

70
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,480
So I'll replace it with four. So it's uh,

71
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:13,560
fourth quarter, 22. So, and if we do this four,

72
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,280
I don't know, next quarter it'll be one.

73
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:21,440
I don't know what VJ means, I guess quarter and then 23,

74
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:26,880
right? So you will put this in the process document and

75
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,000
uh, yeah, no, I guess I'll just pay,

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,000
okay, now I need to confirm this,

77
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,060
um, where it is.

78
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,700
Okay.

79
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,020
Confirmed. Now then that's,

80
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:04,460
um, that's how you transfer v a t minus to the tax office.

81
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,660
Yeah, please create a process document for that.

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,220
And we'll probably have like a folder with,

83
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,860
uh, payments, right? With all this.

84
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,980
So put it here. Put it there. Okay,

85
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,060
thanks. See you later.
