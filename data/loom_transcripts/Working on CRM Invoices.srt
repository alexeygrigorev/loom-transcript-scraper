00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Hi. I hope you're feeling better.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,200
So I finally took some time to work a bit on

3
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:11,580
our CRM and the invoices section.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,820
Because remember we have this problem of not following up with

5
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:19,000
invoices and then it's a mess.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,220
So like, we don't remember who should pay

7
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:28,730
and what is due, at least in my mind it's difficult.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,221
So what you suggested is to create a table in

9
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:38,801
the CRM, which is what I did. So we have a deal table,

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,181
which I did not change. It's the same deal as before.

11
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:47,431
And, yeah, by the way, we need to create invoices for this match,

12
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:52,071
I think. Anyways so what I wanted to do

13
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:55,671
in this video is to explain what I was thinking when creating this table

14
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:58,111
and how to use it. So, hopefully,

15
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:02,721
yeah, it will,

16
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,878
I'll make it easier. Okay,

17
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:09,158
sorry, not distracted. Anyways,

18
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:13,138
so I will take this invoice from Weights and Biases,

19
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:16,098
because it's an interesting one. There was one deal,

20
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:19,418
but four invoices, because we have invoices in different installments.

21
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:22,878
So I want to show you how do we feel in this invoice,

22
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:26,858
but then the rest will be pretty similar. And this is actually the first

23
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:31,378
time I am doing this here, so we will

24
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,458
figure it out right now.

25
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:38,716
So the first thing I do is put the invoice number here in this

26
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:43,046
section, in this column. Then notice for the node,

27
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:46,826
I would put this goal sponsorship second installment.

28
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:53,526
So maybe there is not always,

29
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:58,106
we don't always need the node, but I think for most cases we might.

30
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:04,006
So date sent is, I don't remember when

31
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:07,106
we send it, but let's say it will be 1306,

32
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:11,447
so this is the data. But it actually should be the date when we

33
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:15,807
send the invoice to the email.

34
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:22,257
Alright, so I will put 13 of,

35
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:26,887
what is June? But yeah, it's when we send the invoice.

36
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:33,277
13 of June. The due date is one

37
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:39,617
month after that yeah I think they actually paid it I

38
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:43,117
don't remember when they paid it so we can go to phenome and check

39
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:47,237
when they pay. So status is paid.

40
00:02:49,547 --> 00:02:52,407
And then let me take a moment to explain the statuses.

41
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:58,467
So I've put four statuses to create,

42
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:01,827
created, sent and paid. So to create is,

43
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:06,207
so for example, we already made a deal.

44
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:11,107
For example, we think okay like there will be four installments we know

45
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,149
that there will be four installments for a deal.

46
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:21,289
And when we then

47
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,689
we can already create like a voice, like four different invoices without a number

48
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,409
here. Already put a note and not feeling

49
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,569
everything except like status to create.

50
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:38,969
And then also here we

51
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,789
will, let me, so here this is the link to

52
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:48,412
the deal. So here we will need to match with

53
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,672
the deal. So these deals come from this table,

54
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:55,272
right? So for all the deals we need to make the,

55
00:03:55,752 --> 00:04:00,462
to find the deal of course. And let's wait some biases,

56
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:05,412
right? There should be more intuitive

57
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:08,892
numbers. Custom sponsorship package.

58
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:15,472
We need to work on on that custom sponsorship this

59
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:19,913
one So we need to come up with better names for deals,

60
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:23,393
so it's easier to find. But we link the record from here.

61
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:30,673
So then automatically we see what's the company,

62
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:34,933
the, I don't know why we need, I don't know why we need to

63
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:38,313
know it, let me just remove it. So we need,

64
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,973
we know the company and we know the contact, right?

65
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:43,353
Automatically from here. And by the way,

66
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:45,933
the contact now is different for rates and biases.

67
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:49,451
Please update it. And then for the invoice,

68
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:53,831
so in this case, I think I am confusing you.

69
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:58,811
So let's finish this one. And then I will talk about the

70
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,761
status to create, right? So for this one,

71
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,361
I finish and then I attach the invoice.

72
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:07,701
So the invoice is this one, I already saved it.

73
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:13,961
So this is the invoice.

74
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,682
So then we always have the the file,

75
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:25,922
right? So see that this is the file.

76
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:33,062
And in some cases when we

77
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:35,502
need to update the invoice, we just update the,

78
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:43,222
yeah, update it. So I don't know if we need to add money here.

79
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:48,562
So maybe not, because we don't really need to use it for accounting

80
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,622
or anything. It's more like for keeping track of what is paid,

81
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:53,952
what is not. And what we need to create.

82
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:57,312
So we don't forget to send in an invoice.

83
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:02,732
So date paid, I will put some arbitrary number here.

84
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:05,172
Let's say, I don't,

85
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:08,392
I think they were on time. So maybe double check this.

86
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:11,532
Go to film. We can actually here,

87
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:14,442
see here. Hmm,

88
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:17,402
it was quite late. So it was 30.

89
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:23,542
Not quite late, but they were a little bit late.

90
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:36,674
So yeah, this is how we do it. We need to,

91
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:41,594
like, this is already paid. And then for this weights

92
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:44,754
and biases, so let me show you this to create one.

93
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:49,064
So it's also weights and biases,

94
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:54,014
right? So we don't have an invoice. And by the way,

95
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:58,437
we should create. It right now, third installment,

96
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:04,127
right? So we see that we need to create this invoice for weights

97
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:08,647
and biases. And let me actually already create a duplicate

98
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:14,117
because we need also a fourth installment.

99
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:21,817
So already we have we know that like for this deal,

100
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:27,137
there are some in voices that we still need to create and

101
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:31,627
still, need to well,

102
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:36,057
you know, send. Let me also group like that.

103
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,357
So then we already see,

104
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,717
like, every time we create a record. So we,

105
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:46,917
oops, click here to add a new voice.

106
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:50,757
We feel all this in and then it will go automatically to one of

107
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:53,977
the statuses, right? So I think it's more or less clear.

108
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:58,197
If it's not, yeah, let's talk about that.

109
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:05,031
Okay. So we need to create. So what I want you to do now

110
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:09,051
is go through all the invoices and all the deals for this year only.

111
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:13,191
Don't go to the previous year and fill in this table.

112
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:17,091
Right. And then I will take a look at this and see maybe we

113
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:22,401
forgot something and then maybe if you can think

114
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:26,241
of what can be the deal here.

115
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:31,511
So this one is more like not a name, but more like a comment.

116
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,919
I don't know. We need to think by the way,

117
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:36,579
what is this?

118
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:44,889
We might be interested with the one topic of getting started with data access

119
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,749
management. What is that?

120
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:54,499
Anyways yeah,

121
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,899
please fill this in and then we will see how it goes.

122
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,459
Maybe we will need to adapt it. So that's all.
