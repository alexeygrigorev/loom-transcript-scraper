1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,890
So you ought to do raffles on,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,470
uh, three, so you'll probably get a member of the circle.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,920
So I schedule, yes. And then there's these,

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:15,600
um, this report with some code

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:20,070
for actually keeping track of who retweets the tweet.

6
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:23,600
So later we can select minutes. So what I do at least,

7
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,370
so I select the Euro. Then I go to this,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,620
uh, to this thing, to this project,

9
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:33,330
I will send you the thing. So then I go to actions and then

10
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:37,500
in this actions, I most hear two EDS tweets.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,440
And then I click around. Now I put the Euro

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,770
and yeah, important that it shouldn't start with mobile.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,410
So it should be just the Euro from the pollution.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,750
And then you click on, so now it will,

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,720
um, it would, I don't see it.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,610
Oh yeah, it is here. So now yeah,

17
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,260
this is fine. You think?

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,220
Hmm. Yeah, it should be quite fast.

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,490
Let's say it's not important of what it's doing here.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,250
The important part is when I go,

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,670
when it finishes. Yeah. So now it's finished,

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,250
you see this, uh,

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,580
this, uh, like a tick that it's successful.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,690
So then they can go back and see that there is a commit from

25
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,240
GitHub actions. So this commit,

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,590
it's a line here in tweets.

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,690
This one. So this is that we can check that you texted,

28
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,210
it was edit. Then at the same time,

29
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:47,280
what's also happened. It created this d*** there with,

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,180
uh, , um,

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,090
that's not super important, but you see what actually is happening in

32
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:59,100
this file. Uh,

33
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:04,290
we have, uh, names of people who come

34
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,360
see it here. All right.

35
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:10,290
So these names are here. And then from this names later,

36
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,340
it will select five minutes. Or you have the,

37
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,400
I guess this is not the important part. The important part is like how

38
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,590
you think of the sink. And I guess let's say the most important

39
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,490
part. And then what will happen later is every hour,

40
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,580
all the people who repeated end like

41
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:38,130
to be in it. Okay. That's all, that's how you start

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,200
watching you start monitoring this thing. So it makes sure that we don't because

43
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,080
the problem is with, um,

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,140
keeps the last hundred liters.

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,410
So we need to pay entirely. That's why we need,

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,320
okay. Anyways. Yeah. The important part of this call you just for your information.
