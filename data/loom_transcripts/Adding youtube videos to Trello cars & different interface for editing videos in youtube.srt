00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,270
Hello. Yeah, so I noticed the,

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,310
I don't think we add links to YouTube.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,950
Um, like for example, this was Tomash with Tomic,

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,510
like we don't have YouTube link.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,430
So I think it would be a good idea to actually not forget adding

6
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:20,550
this link. So for example,

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,510
for Andre, Okay,

8
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,990
this is not the link. Okay,

9
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:29,270
so just do this.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,570
Right? So then it's just simpler. And let's say if I want to go

11
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:39,850
and edit it, I just click here and then I

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,170
go to edit it. So I don't need to find it.

13
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:48,530
It's, it's there. Another thing I wanted to ask you is,

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,850
um, right now the interface here is different.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,650
So they changed. Okay. This one is, uh,

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,810
being processed. Let me, let me take another one.

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,810
So maybe I don't know this one I will not edit

18
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,170
it of course, but till when we do trim,

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,900
you see, Oh, oops, sorry. So when we do,

20
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,620
I'll go back.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,660
So when I, when I click it and trim

22
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:22,820
and cut, you see that there is this, uh,

23
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:25,100
new thing that we can just, oops. Uh,

24
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:25,580
where it is.

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,060
Ah, right. So it's here. So I think they were,

26
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:39,430
the way to get it is we go to Editor Dream.

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,460
It should appear here. Oh, I don't,

28
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:47,870
I don't know why it's not appearing. Maybe I just need to refresh

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,650
that. You probably know what I mean. Like that there is this,

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,590
uh, bar that we can,

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,870
uh, just, uh, move.

32
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,050
Ah, yeah. Here it is. Right. So then it's usually just,

33
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,480
uh, you know, moving it here.

34
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,500
So maybe you can, um, show it.

35
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,320
Uh, let me make sure I don't accidentally say it.

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,520
Maybe you can update the process doc, because I remember previously it was different.

37
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,770
Okay. And, um, <affirmative>, that's whole.

38
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,330
And I will record another video now.
