1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,270
Do you use veto? So for some reasons, I didn't have a couple of

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:07,200
fields there. So the fields that are also important,

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:10,560
but missing is this book, cover URL and book power.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,020
Um, yeah, this is not the best name.

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:17,640
I will change it to, to look more human than

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:21,870
that. Um, but here their ideas is very similar to what you do with

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,360
speaker profile. So you need to,

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,730
um, now either put the book,

9
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:31,350
cover URL or upload a cover. So Miller actually gave me already

10
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:36,030
the cover. So I need to download this let's say from which

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,650
yes. Yes. So now let me check on

12
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:46,260
the size of this thing. So pretty

13
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,960
weak. I don't need that big, so I don't know.

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,220
You can use whatever program you want for resizing the image.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,030
I will use X and view.

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,130
So then, uh, I will change it to,

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,880
Hm, well, this is pretty small,

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,510
maybe 300 by 400.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,410
Okay. And this is button. So now I save it.

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,160
So in, um, actually to the size,

21
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,090
it, what I did is I did shift S then,

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,170
uh, shift, test opens this window. Then I choose this one,

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,520
this one, and decided, I don't know if you need to document this,

24
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:31,890
you you're free to use whatever two,

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,970
you are comfortable with 40 size images anyways.

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,650
So I do this, then I click safe.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,380
Yeah. This there image.

28
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:51,240
And now I can go to this form and

29
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,900
this one, this old one. So yeah.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,430
And the book cover, and I upload this.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,300
So this is how you do this. I'll click upload.

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,700
So this is how you do this. Uh, so it's either Euro for some

33
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:13,920
books, for example, for mining books or books mining.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,280
So let's see for mining, I will show you how to do this with

35
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,460
mining books. So for mining books,

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,570
it's a little bit tricky. Um,

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,890
so let's take this one. Um,

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,680
this is not a book, so,

39
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,070
uh, for example, least exploring a data science career.

40
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,890
So this is a book, um,

41
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,540
and the, when you click it, doesn't show you the safe as,

42
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,450
uh, like a safe image.

43
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:48,150
Yes. So what I need to do is click inspect,

44
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,560
and then in inspect,

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,130
um, and SPECT this,

46
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,290
this image, right? And then the,

47
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,740
the Euro of these things here.

48
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,040
I don't know if it's visible, if it was clear what I did.

49
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,880
So I clicked on this link, then I click inspect,

50
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,000
and then it brings me to this image in HTML,

51
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,020
and then it has this SFC think this is the thing that we need

52
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:26,890
to, uh, copy and then paste it.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,640
And then here, the book is, it's already quite small,

54
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,190
so you can just take this and

55
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,730
just take it and put it here and then for

56
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,600
pocketbooks. Uh, so let me check pocket books.

57
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,130
So for pocket books, I think you just try to click on this copy

58
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,140
image address, and, um,

59
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,440
uh, what did here think there's just an actual hook

60
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,900
and then we have also Reilly books.

61
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,780
Um, so for example,  publications.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,900
Yeah. So this is a book on Australia. So open this in incognito,

63
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,850
because for you, it will look like that for me to different.

64
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,720
And then yeah, for our island book, uh,

65
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,390
we'll just do copy image address as well.

66
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,150
And then, uh,

67
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,850
put it here. Do not copy.

68
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,590
Yeah. And you can check that this is actually information from,

69
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,250
uh, for pact, for Riley and for mining.

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,410
Usually they have small images,

71
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:46,990
so you don't need to resize this. Yeah.

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,310
So this is how you feel the image or fields in.
