00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,870
Um, hi, I wanted to show you how to update calendar invites.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,270
Every time you create an event in Eventbrite,

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,590
a calendar event is created and on Google calendar.

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,110
So we have a public public public calendar.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,220
So if you go to Datadog, um,

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,240
events, we have this, a Google calendar,

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,020
which is a public calendar for everyone to subscribe to the events.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,810
If they let's say don't want to subscribe to Eventbrite,

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,450
they just can't get these events in the calendar.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,930
And one of the events that we had,

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,620
um, remember you counted, it was a bit longer.

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:41,370
So instead of one hour workshop,

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,910
right? And they want to show you how to,

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,300
you can edit this events. So this is the events from that calendar.

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,840
And I will make sure that you actually have edit permissions.

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,100
So you just click it and change it all one hour.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,090
So in this case, it's simple. Sometimes when a guest asks to reschedule,

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,180
they went to Google need to do this manually.

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,200
This is not a, it's not like if you update something on Eventbrite,

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,050
it's automatically updates here. Now it's not like that.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,560
It only creates an event when you create an event in Eventbrite,

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,310
but then all the changes afterwards you have to be done manually.

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,700
So just pick safe and you see it's um,

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,080
yeah, it's updated. So, and then others in the calendar,

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,720
in their calendar suppose see the updated.

26
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,320
And now I would just give you a permission.

27
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,540
So next time you will be able to do it yourself as well.
