1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,620
Okay. So regarding this officer think here,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,420
so indeed they contract with support that this is relative to the beginning

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,750
of the meeting, not to the beginning of the recording.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,280
That's why it's all. So the recording is shorter than this thing.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,880
Um, and Yeah,

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:24,090
so I want to show you, so I asked them to fix this,

7
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,680
but before they fix this in zoom, we can do a workaround.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,450
So what I did Say it a

9
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,570
quarter to another one. So what I will do,

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,080
um, For the next months,

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,430
I will write that in the chat. So we'll have a timestamp when we

12
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:49,140
actually started recording And towards the we'll deal with this

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,740
for the staff, You will go see here,

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,250
this is the spreadsheet they just created and shared with you.

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,990
<v 1>Let's see here,

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,910
This is the

17
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:00,450
<v 1>Location.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,660
And here you need to, in this,

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,030
in this cell, you will need to add this timestamp in this format.

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,960
and then minutes and seconds, And then it will change the format

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,420
of the Madigan. But this is important.

22
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:23,700
Two hours here. Otherwise Google later

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,710
will not know how to what's this. So this is

24
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,170
the start. And then we write the regional timestamps.

25
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,780
Yeah. So the regional timestamps here,

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,170
so this is the laptops we need for editing.

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,750
So,

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,930
And what we do next is we use a formula here And

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,990
we, so the formula is B2 and resell a minus

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,340
a to B cell. But when we,

31
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,400
we need to change eight to a little bit.

32
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,820
So we need to add some dollars here, Aren't you?

33
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,120
So the formula is B two minus a dollar,

34
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:13,770
a dollar. And the reason we need this dollar is when

35
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:16,050
we make this formula dome,

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,510
is that you see it changes to obesity and so on,

37
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,810
but eight to stays the same. So you don't Wait.

38
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,500
So that's why we need it. And yes,

39
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,240
it'll be spotless. Maybe they can just do all the way down.

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,360
So you don't actually need to worry about this foremost,

41
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:40,140
or you wouldn't need to do is just put the stuff here in original

42
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,180
timestamps. And,

43
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,840
um,

44
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,920
You know, it's, the team will,  Also,

45
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,230
I contacted support and ask them,

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,130
um, what was the beginning or when the meeting started and when the recording

47
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,710
started recording started what the, this one,

48
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,120
This file, but the one who said problems with,

49
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,040
and they told me that the meeting started at this time and important started

50
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:13,570
at this time. So here it means that the

51
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,240
actual meetings to the minutes,

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,570
so the start should be this one.

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,130
And now what we'll do is we will just takes these

54
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:31,750
timestamps. And The

55
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,800
first one, This is the second one.

56
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,280
There is one.

57
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,800
Yeah, let me check it the sexually timestamps,

58
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:57,000
make sense. So I'll go now to three 11,

59
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,130
<v 2>We are building an, also a new language that we are building,

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,710
uh, that is called sort of seal, uh, which is,

61
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,170
um, sorta checks language and,

62
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:12,660
um, the tool that is going to, uh,

63
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,190
evaluate everything that is written and sort of seal is called sort of core.

64
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,730
So what is sort of seal, uh, sort of seal as a DSL for

65
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:25,350
data reliability? So

66
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:27,840
what are we going to show today? Uh,

67
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,300
I'd like to show, uh, a new,

68
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,930
um, a tool that we're building and also a new language that we are

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,360
building, uh, that is called sort of seal,

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,450
which is, um, sorta checks language and,

71
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,910
um, the tool that is going to, uh,

72
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,470
evaluate everything that is written and sort of seal it's called sort of core.

73
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,980
So what is sort of seal, uh, sort of seal as a DSL for

74
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:52,770
data reliability, TSLP, the domain specific language?

75
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,290
I do not think it is correct.

76
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:58,990
Um,

77
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,210
I'm wondering the why Let's check this seven

78
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,690
15.

79
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,720
<v 2>Uh, you can see that

80
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,850
I created already, uh, with,

81
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,250
um, the tool installed for the sake of,

82
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,640
uh, time. Uh, so like me activate

83
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,790
Or so here, you can see.

84
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,130
Yeah, I think this is not working it because this is

85
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:51,540
not right. The, probably something is wrong.

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,380
I don't know what, um,

87
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,500
but I can see, uh, like from this calculation,

88
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,870
if you subtract six, uh, five,

89
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,200
uh, you do you pick a plate,

90
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,990
so this looks correct. So five,

91
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,640
so this should be the correct time stamp. I think the problem is with

92
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,160
that. So trying to figure out what the stat is,

93
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,850
and then you're going to use this timestamps for editing.

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,260
And then after that, or the nuance will always ankles

95
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,630
too, but they will always also write to that.

96
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,570
So then you know that this will be a,

97
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,700
and to see that say like when the

98
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,540
recording started.
