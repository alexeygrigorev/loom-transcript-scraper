1
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:04,883
So I want to show you how to delete a file from GitHub and

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:07,471
how to delete. So we need to actually delete a book of the week,

3
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:12,525
but what I show is actually actually works for

4
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:14,550
delete in any file, right?

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:18,529
So in this specific thing uh, in the process document that we will create,

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,752
we will talk about delete in 8-4,

7
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:22,795
a book of the week.

8
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:25,038
Umm.

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,383
And so this is what we want to delete this understanding ETL.

10
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:33,375
And we click on that. And actually the first thing I wanted to show

11
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:38,161
you is instead of deleting what I could do is

12
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:40,794
instead of creating a new one and deleting the old one,

13
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,728
what we could do is actually just edit this one,

14
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:47,133
right? So when we edit, there is beginning,

15
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:50,969
there is start and end. So we could just change it,

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,332
right? Of course the name,

17
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:58,308
the old the old name is also possible to change,

18
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,435
but what would be sufficient is just changing the start,

19
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:07,711
the end date. And yeah, you can also change the file name,

20
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:12,027
right? But right now I want to show you how to delete and please

21
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:16,793
also create a separate process document for showing how to

22
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:19,910
delete, umm.

23
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:24,591
Bye. How to edit the beginning and end or

24
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:27,965
in general how to edit the book of the week stuff.

25
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:31,739
Okay. So here I want to show you how to delete.

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,112
So this is where we came previously.

27
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:36,677
We'll click here and,

28
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:38,820
and uh we'll click on this thing, right?

29
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,344
So I need to scroll a little bit down. Umm,

30
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:45,558
for you or interface it might be different but I need to scroll a

31
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:48,482
little bit down and then I see delete file.

32
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,876
And also,

33
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:55,459
now we will delete it. Thank you. What is important to note is this

34
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,794
path to you. So I will copy it.

35
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:00,938
Umm,

36
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:10,207
I'll put it to a note right now. Umm.

37
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,128
This is the path that umm.

38
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:18,356
We need. Umm.

39
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:20,819
Right now I will delete it.

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,832
So click on that.

41
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,118
Can we change this now? Right glitz.

42
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:27,601
Umm.

43
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:30,465
So now the fire was gone. We don't see it here.

44
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:33,830
But some of the files that we also need to delete are not gone

45
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:36,234
yet. So they are contained here.

46
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:40,488
In images. So now we go up.

47
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:47,969
We'll go to images. We'll

48
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,824
go to books. Now we'll go to me. I can name this thing.

49
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:53,860
Yeah. So.

50
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:58,475
Let me show you the one on there.

51
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:00,779
We'll go to images.

52
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,791
We'll go to books.

53
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:05,425
And we need to find that book.

54
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:09,430
So see. This is here. So this is the path.

55
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,303
So we'll go here and that.

56
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:16,103
We can delete each file individually like we did last time,

57
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:20,180
right? So click on that and delete what I think here is possible to

58
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:24,076
delete the entire directory. So again.

59
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:28,728
So. Okay. So

60
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,041
you click on this dot, dot, dot.

61
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:34,585
Delete directory. So you review the list of files.

62
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:37,518
So just do files. Can we change this?

63
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,392
Now what the file is going? Or what the file is?

64
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:43,355
The directory is going. Umm,

65
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,933
this is how you delete, uhm. Book of the week.

66
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:50,560
Um, so from this video you please create three process

67
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:53,203
documents. So first created generic,

68
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:57,820
uh, process document describing how to delete a file and the

69
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,579
directory from GitHub. Thank you.

70
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:06,897
Then create another process document that describes how to uh,

71
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:11,503
edit a book of the week event or page

72
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:14,857
how to locate. So from the very beginning like from the top of the

73
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:19,417
repository it should go from the top of repository like exactly how to

74
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:23,342
locate the file and what to edit and how.

75
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:30,381
And also how to delete the entire book of the week file.

76
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:34,370
So they're described that um this is where the file is,

77
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:38,899
where this is the images is, are and you can refer to the first

78
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,234
process document for details on how to delete it.

79
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,497
Okay. Thank you.
