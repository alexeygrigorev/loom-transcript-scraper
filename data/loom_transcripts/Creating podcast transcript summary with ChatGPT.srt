1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,590
Okay, so I changed, um,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,590
the template for the, uh,

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:09,270
for the newsletter slightly. So for the podcast session now,

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,550
we also have a list with bulleted points.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,310
In addition to just that, we uploaded a new podcast episode.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,910
Then there is no line break. And then we have the title,

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,070
then, uh, yeah, name, then a bulleted list and then a button.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,830
So I created, I updated a template here,

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,190
right? So this is how it looks like. So then for the button,

10
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,790
you will need to put the,

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,270
the address here. I will not do this because right now it's,

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,590
uh, uh, yeah, this is, um,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,950
a template it, right?

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,990
And then I wanted to show you how to actually get these things right.

15
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:49,150
For that, I ask you to register here in chat,

16
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:51,310
open eye chat,

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,830
chat, open eye. Then I already have an example here that I

18
00:00:58,831 --> 00:00:59,150
used.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,390
<v 1>Yeah,

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,510
Here. Oops,

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,550
what happened?

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,770
It doesn't work, I guess. Um,

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,970
yeah, so the,

24
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:23,650
what I put here is, first I open this

25
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,690
chat, ai, and they write, this is a transcript of podcast episode.

26
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:29,290
Alex is the host, Andrina is the guest.

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,570
So here, of course, we should change the name depending on,

28
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,170
um, the guest. And I can show you a different example,

29
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:40,050
maybe not with Rina. Uh,

30
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:43,250
I'll show you for example, with an Angelica.

31
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,970
So, and, and gay Angelica is the guest.

32
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:51,490
Please write a summary as a bullet,

33
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:56,370
at least with 10 items. Then I put this line like with five minuses,

34
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,690
and then I copy everything starting from transcript till

35
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:01,970
the end.

36
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,260
So I copy this one and place

37
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:14,710
it here, right?

38
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:19,430
That's all I do. I hit enter. And,

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,190
uh, yeah,

40
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:27,430
this is a summary, and what you do is you copy the summary to

41
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,630
here, to this one points,

42
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,910
and then this one you feel like previously,

43
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,710
right? So please update a process, document for that.

44
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,270
And also, right now we don't use this,

45
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:41,350
but I want to use it in the future. And,

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,150
um, I'll show you what I mean.

47
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:47,270
So I'll say write, um,

48
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,910
memorable quotes from the AP

49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,550
sort.

50
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,120
Yeah. So I think, uh, this could be,

51
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,560
um, yeah,

52
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,760
this is, uh, like ai, right?

53
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:10,480
So not all of these things are good.

54
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,780
Uh, like, okay, for example, this one is not really memorable or

55
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:20,300
this one, right? But, but you see some of the quotes may make sense.

56
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,580
Maybe extract 20 memoir

57
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,260
from the, from the transcript.

58
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,580
So, and we can actually use this for generating some

59
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,500
content on Twitter. So some of these,

60
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,380
uh, quotes are not super, like,

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,500
not nice. Some of them are nice. And then for now,

62
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,060
uh, we will not do much with this quotes.

63
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:58,100
I just wanted to show you so you know how to do this because

64
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:00,300
we no, why, it's, why it stopped,

65
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,900
because we probably will use this for publishing stuff on Twitter.

66
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,140
Okay? I don't know if it's done. Maybe it is.

67
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:12,740
But anyways, this is, uh, I guess this could be the reason why it's

68
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:16,180
not working. Okay. This is what I wanted to show you.

69
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,260
And, uh, yeah, please,

70
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,340
uh, update the, or create a process document for,

71
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,900
for use using this chat. Um,

72
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,260
open eye for extracting summary.
