1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,070
Um, by the way, with this reminder, what you can do is,

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,910
you know,

3
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,340
you're going to sign this thing to me, this upload the recording,

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,400
you see that. So it's that, it's a me,

5
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:17,910
it shouldn't be me. And then you can send it to,

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,400
um, let's say immediately on the day of the event.

7
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:26,550
So if the savant is,

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,730
let's say third March,

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,630
so then you can send it, send it to,

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,870
yeah. So then I see that I should

11
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:44,920
do this and then I do this and probably they will get some sort

12
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:47,020
of email from throw.

13
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:49,300
I assume that I need to do it.

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,150
And the next day I did it. So

15
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:58,090
this is when you clone a template.

16
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,870
When you create a car from a template, you can also send a set

17
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:03,880
a reminder and then assign this thing to me.
