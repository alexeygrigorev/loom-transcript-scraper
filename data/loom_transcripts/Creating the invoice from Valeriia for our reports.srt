00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,930
Hi. So this is the invoice that Valeria created or template,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,770
and I wanted, um, so we need to pay here every month.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,410
So every month there will be an automatic transfer to your account from

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,210
our pH, right? Uh,

5
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:20,410
but for the report, for our tax report,

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,890
we need an invoice, right? So this is the invoice for the first month,

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,410
and I want to show you what we need to do, what we will

8
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:30,050
need to do every month to, um,

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,500
to include, uh, like what we will need to change in this invoice to

10
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,060
include it in our report, right?

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,540
So, um, the only thing we will need to do is change

12
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:50,180
this part. So this is where the invoice number and

13
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:52,500
dates are. So here, uh,

14
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,540
for example, for the next month, uh, when the report will be,

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,220
uh, when the invoice will be generated in March.

16
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:01,100
So we change this thing, we change this thing.

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,820
So this is the prefix for the invoice, this is the date for the

18
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:09,580
invoice. And then services provided in March would be February,

19
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,940
March, right?

20
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:17,100
And in, um, April it would be March,

21
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:21,620
April, and so on, right? So for every month there will be the

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,500
previous month and the current month. And then,

23
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,260
yeah. So these are the three things we need to change. Now let me

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,140
unchange them, and then now you just,

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,740
uh, download a PDF

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,170
And include it in our, um,

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,650
in our report, like usual. So now I will include this invoice and

28
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:50,810
it'll have today's date. I guess it's not,

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,810
uh, really a big problem, right? Um,

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,090
okay, I will just send you the invoice and then you will take care

31
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:59,250
of that, or no,

32
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,610
I will send it through the usual process,

33
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:05,650
right? And then, uh, you will see it in the,

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,810
uh, in the bookkeeping report.

35
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,770
But for the next month, when you see that there is a line in

36
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:14,530
our phenome, then you know what to do.
