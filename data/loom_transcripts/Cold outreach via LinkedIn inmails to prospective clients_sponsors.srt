1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,460
Um, hi. So I wanted to show you how to reach out to companies

2
00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:09,970
and offer them sponsorship or something like this.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,500
Um, like this is basically how I find clients.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,700
So th th this is a company I want to write to,

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,510
so I'm subscribed to their newsletter, and I see that the,

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,460
uh, some events they want to actually help them promote this

7
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:32,080
events. So I want to reach out to them and asked if

8
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,540
they're interested in, uh, working together.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,790
So the way, uh, the, one of the options would be just to reply

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,000
to this email and then say something.

11
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,710
So I will not do it right now. So what I will do instead

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,430
is I will try to reach out to them through LinkedIn.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,290
And, um, yeah, so I will show you colleges,

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,340
sisters, they need the name of the company.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,450
So I copy this name of the company,

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,070
and then I go to LinkedIn and then I put the name of the

17
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:11,410
company and then something like community.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,280
So I usually try community and marketing.

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,140
So these are the people who are responsible for,

20
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,890
uh, these kind of things or promoting these kinds of things.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,780
And these are people who would potentially be interested in promoting some

22
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:32,410
stuff through our newsletter, or maybe sponsor in the community.

23
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,070
And we have two people who are potentially,

24
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,360
um, relevant for this. So marketing director and community managers.

25
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:48,490
So these are the kind of people who are usually interested in,

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,350
uh, uh, promoting. Oh,

27
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,610
thanks. Okay. So optimum their accounts.

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,790
And, uh, yeah.

29
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:03,420
So the first thing I do usually is I,

30
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:08,010
uh, um, so I already sent Sarah

31
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:11,970
connection request. So we'll show you here with,

32
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,940
uh, with Nama,

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,620
how I do this. So I do connect and then note

34
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,440
I data box.

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,310
Well, that's all I write. Um,

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,330
and so I already did this for Maya.

37
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,990
So now I want to write an email to Maya and

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,270
email. Uh,

39
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,630
yeah. So for email, we need to write a subject smell,

40
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:45,540
right? I wrong data blocks.

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,870
And then, um, I need to come

42
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,090
up with a message again,

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,160
sorry, message here. Uh,

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,780
<v 1>It's just a message.  people

45
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,150
for data without, so this,

46
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,220
like every, everyone will receive the same message and

47
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,590
here, this is like a personalized thing.

48
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,470
So this one will be like,

49
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,160
by name, then this is the,

50
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,510
um, the line.

51
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:26,020
And then this is personalized plan, and this is close.

52
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,470
The message. Uh, please let me know if it's something interesting for you and

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,930
you need so for this one,

54
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:34,510
I already prepared the line. So I was wondering if,

55
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,030
uh, this name I cannot pronounce,

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,950
we'll be interested in working with us.  we

57
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,470
can talk, you promote this lens, uh,

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,630
in hopes related content.

59
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,680
Okay. This is the message I will send to her.

60
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,450
And by the way, I see that they are organizing a conference.

61
00:03:55,451 --> 00:04:00,210
So thirst, I will, uh,

62
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,430
check, um,

63
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,770
welcome to C.

64
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,160
And

65
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,540
so are they, Ryan is similar anytime soon.

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,970
I think it was last year.

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,470
<v 1>Uh, I think so too. Yeah,

68
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,060
I think so. It was last year. So this is mark.

69
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,150
Can you see, so all ride share this,

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,140
um, and, and that will write something like these

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,690
near you long

72
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,090
will be June or June.

73
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,100
So this a personalized message.

74
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,860
This is, um, but at the beginning,

75
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,700
maybe I will come with these things, but,

76
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,920
uh, this is pretty standard, I think,

77
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,740
so that it will be like personalized stuff.

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,530
Um, this is some of the stuff now.

79
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,020
I just sent her email and hope she replies.

80
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,570
Now let's see now many of people

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,390
who I write to not play, but some do.

82
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,340
And this is how we actually find people,

83
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,950
companies to, um,

84
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,670
like to support us and promote things through the newsletter.

85
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,850
Okay. That's all for me.
