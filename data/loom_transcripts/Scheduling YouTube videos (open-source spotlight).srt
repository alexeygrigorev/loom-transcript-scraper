1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,500
I want to show how to schedule videos in this particular case,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,220
I'm going to schedule a open-source spotlight video,

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,770
this one. So I'm going to click on details.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,540
And first of all, time code, this was like a placeholder.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,730
This is the place where time calls will go.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,850
So we don't need that. Um,

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,660
yeah. Then for open source spotlight, we need to select playlist playlist

8
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,990
should be open source spotlight done.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,990
Then PTO then, uh,

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,590
to I click here,

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,180
visibility clicks, Cato, and I'm going to schedule it

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,770
for today 5:00 PM.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,220
And this is central European time. And

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,130
I just click down. So now scheduled.

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,350
Yeah, I think that's all I needed to do was,

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,100
uh, sorry. Now we don't have a 10 table when exactly we should,

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,690
but at least this typically happens on Wednesdays.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,190
So, so typically it happens on Wednesdays.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,500
Uh, for example, the next one, this aim open source

20
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:32,090
spotlight about aim. Once we have time codes and

21
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:36,770
links from the speaker, we will release it for

22
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:40,400
the next Wednesday. Yeah.

23
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,820
Which is 23, 20

24
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:48,860
third. I will not go in.

25
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,350
I am not going to release it right now.

26
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,620
So once we have 10 calls, then we can schedule it.

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,920
Okay. Some things, this is how your schedule

28
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,560
will be just.
