1
00:00:00,281 --> 00:00:04,818
Okay, so I was checking the problem you mentioned yesterday about not being

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,727
able to create multiple events in one event Yeah,

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,560
so what we can do to fix that?

4
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:16,905
First of all, the reason we needed multiple events and do not forget to

5
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:21,832
also include this in the process document when you update So

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:26,337
the reason Okay, let me see So this is

7
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:30,473
what you should include in the context of the process document So we need

8
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:35,351
uhm Project of the week is a multi-day event

9
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:40,087
So it takes the entire week And we want

10
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:44,604
people to get reminders every day about the event and what they

11
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,928
need to do during the day Right?

12
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:52,385
So previously we used a multi-multi-event,

13
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,891
sorry Or whatever it was called, I don't remember Uhm,

14
00:00:55,892 --> 00:01:00,808
so here, as you see, it's no longer available Bummer, but

15
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,876
we can work around that By going to emails And

16
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:09,207
then And sending a reminder So here,

17
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:14,627
we can Select Ray So we will need to manually Add

18
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:19,327
10 reminders But you can just copy-paste And we will probably have

19
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:25,957
a template from the previous Like

20
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,901
how we created previously. So we have a template So,

21
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:34,020
uhm We're gonna create an event which is in the template we used previously,

22
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:39,168
so please update the process document

23
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:43,133
and instead of using one event,

24
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:47,268
instead of using multiple events, create a new reminders,

25
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:52,956
so this is starting tomorrow,

26
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:55,831
it's fine, starting in one hour,

27
00:01:55,832 --> 00:02:00,725
no we don't need that And

28
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:04,585
then we just need to create 7 different emails,

29
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:11,485
so this one we'll remove, so

30
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:14,026
we'll create 7 different emails,

31
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,546
so please find out what these emails are,

32
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:23,386
I don't remember, and uhm And

33
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:28,115
yeah, let's have a template for them. And

34
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:31,760
also for this one, so we will need to replace it,

35
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:36,167
I'll send you the link to a video,

36
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:40,660
so we will need to change the URL.

37
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:45,222
But this is, this will be later.

38
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:47,325
So let's update the process documents,

39
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:50,871
send me the process documents for checking, send me the templates we used for

40
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:55,886
checking, they are probably also uhm in

41
00:02:55,887 --> 00:03:00,243
the same process document. So let's update that and this is how we do

42
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:04,470
it, do it, we add emails and do not forget that we need to

43
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:09,508
remove this uhm

44
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:13,674
And I'm wondering if we do this, this is something we send immediately,

45
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:16,590
right? Yeah,

46
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:19,222
whatever. So we are interested in scheduled emails.
