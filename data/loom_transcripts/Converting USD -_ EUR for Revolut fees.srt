Hi, so uhm,

2
00:00:03,716 --> 00:00:08,485
we had quite a bunch of US dollars which I just converted

3
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:13,264
to Euros and I just added a fee

4
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:18,714
PDF to our uhm Dropbox,

5
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:22,540
right? And what I wanted to record in this video is That's how we

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,896
should put this, the euro amount.

7
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:28,342
So for this one, we see that there is an exchange rate.

8
00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:33,771
So what we can do is uh, so this is what

9
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:38,399
we use. This is the exchange rate, and this is the amount of dollars

10
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,324
for the fee. So what I put,

11
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:47,736
I just multiply one by another, and this is actually what we put to

12
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:54,468
our bookkeeping spreadsheet, right? So this is the amount of euros that we put

13
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:57,655
when we bookkeep it, because we have it here.

14
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:01,205
We don't always have it, but when we do it in Revolut,

15
00:01:01,707 --> 00:01:03,853
we can, we can see it.
