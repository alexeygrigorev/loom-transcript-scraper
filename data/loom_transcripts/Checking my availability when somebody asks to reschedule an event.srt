1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,760
I when somebody asks,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,540
if they can reschedule, I want to show you how to check my calendar

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,160
if I have available spots. So go to Google

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,580
and then you're in search for people,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,520
bright mind.com.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,310
And then you will see my calendar. I see,

7
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,590
like where I am busy,

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,480
where I cannot do and sometimes

9
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:38,640
okay. Empty slots. So generally in this

10
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:43,200
serve things here, this slot, like from five to six in

11
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,650
your time zone, it's probably different. Yeah.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,310
So you want me to sit in this spot here?

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,450
Um, so when they ask a what can move to a different

14
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:01,980
days, for example, in this case that is asked to do it

15
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:04,830
on 21st, I think you already created,

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,260
okay. So here you would see that I

17
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:14,970
am, and then you can apply it to the

18
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:17,010
guests, to the speaker that, okay.

19
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,010
Yeah, we can do it on 24th at this land.

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,310
We both have access to my calendar and you see that.

21
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:26,550
I don't have anything else, but let's say if I said something,

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,340
then it would say, maybe we can do it Thursday

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,300
31st, for example. Yeah.

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,220
And this time here, 12 to 13,

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,220
usually I am available.

26
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,340
So this busy thing here is lunch.

27
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,130
So I make it,

28
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,980
uh, make myself busy. So people don't put meetings well lunch,

29
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,990
but in general, if somebody wants to move podcast event,

30
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,020
then we can also do this around lunchtime.

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,170
So for me, it's fine too sometimes. Uh,

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,350
okay. So yeah, because this is how you check my apple ability when somebody

33
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,790
asks to reschedule.
