1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,630
Um, K if you comments about the,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,180
the, the podcast document we create.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,760
So usually we already know what we talk about and all the topics.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,200
So this X you need to replace with recruiting lead engineers,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,800
the topic we have the special guests today.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,890
So we already know who the guest is.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,930
And, um, uh, yeah, it's also his name.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,520
Then also this X is the,

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,770
basically the same thing. Cause here.

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:42,890
Yeah.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,060
And beyond by this is something that Nicholas needs to put in title

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,620
we're ordering and all the title, including the engineers with

13
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:59,250
this one, the titles, not clear position, digital subtitle.

14
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:03,600
We need to think about this, but usually the format for that is subtitle

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,170
some subtitle then minus that it's happened.

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,320
And then the, the full name of the guest.

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,060
So it shouldn't be like that. So when you create a document at the

18
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:20,040
very least, you can already feel that and that,

19
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,120
and that, and the set up, because now you can also put the title

20
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:28,980
here and this thing and this and

21
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:33,810
other things. Yeah. Thanks a lot for converting my handwriting into proper text.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,920
You don't need to put numbers here. They're there.

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,450
So yeah.
