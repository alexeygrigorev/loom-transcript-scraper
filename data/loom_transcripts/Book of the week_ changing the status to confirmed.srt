As you see Roy answered that,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,330
uh, the date works for him. So then we go to our

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:13,740
table and then we can say that date proposed,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,230
we can say, okay,

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,750
so now what do we need to do for this one is,

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,010
uh, making an announcement. So do the same thing as we did for this

7
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:32,790
one, filled the form and then I will make an announcement post one.

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,260
Yeah. And, uh, yeah, I sent you a list of things,

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,990
but this is regarding the next steps,

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,940
but I guess what I wanted to say with this video is that

11
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:52,140
we can change the status, that it was changed,

12
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,960
the status from proposed to confirm.
