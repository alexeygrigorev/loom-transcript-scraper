1
00:00:00,928 --> 00:00:05,358
So I wanted to show you how to update videos in this github repository.

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,327
So this github repo is for the course and

3
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:14,771
we have different modules here. So let's me first open the playlist where you

4
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:18,776
upload the videos. So in this playlist,

5
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:24,584
so this is the playlist and we have this

6
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:30,521
video right. Previously we had um

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:36,048
this one, oh sorry, so here we still if

8
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,332
so what I did is um this is the repo and then I just

9
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:44,063
clicked on the first module because we are here it's one 1.2 which means

10
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:48,163
we need to go to the first module and I just scroll down and

11
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:52,823
we have the these links right and now if I open it it will

12
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:57,493
go to the old video. Hi everyone in this video I want to

13
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:01,860
show you how to configure it. I don't know if you hear the recording

14
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:06,487
here but like there's this ding sound and then it's not as loud

15
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:09,171
as this one. In this video I want to show.

16
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:13,275
Yeah. So this is the new one and that was the one is the

17
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:17,844
old one. So what we want to do is to replace these

18
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:20,028
links. All right.

19
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:25,487
So this is the link. So let's scroll to 1.2.

20
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:28,547
This is 1.2.

21
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:31,507
Right. And here we have this link.

22
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,599
So I will send it to, uh,

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,864
to, you know, Telegram. So you have it.

24
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:42,864
Okay,

25
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:47,798
so this is the link. And there are two places.

26
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:52,097
The first one First, there are two things that we need to care about.

27
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,543
So the first is this parameter.

28
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,969
So that starts with a question mark B equals.

29
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:03,002
else. this is the video, and the second one is the playlist.

30
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,750
So for this course, for LLMZoomCamp,

31
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:12,521
this is the ID of this playlist. You can see it here.

32
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:14,815
So this is the link, right?

33
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,099
So this is the video, and this is the playlist.

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,163
So for this one, we don't change the playlist.

35
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:23,656
We just take the link and we update.

36
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:27,142
The link here, right? We update it here and we update it here,

37
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:30,608
right? So this is the the second video.

38
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:33,133
We also need to update it for the third.

39
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,230
Let me just do that. I'll do it here. Oops.

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,076
Hi everyone. Welcome back. I'll,

41
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,201
uh, I'll do it here so we don't,

42
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:47,906
uh, so I don't wait till you update it.

43
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:50,851
Again, we'll just update it in two places.

44
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:53,536
Now for,

45
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:58,885
Welcome back. Let us update

46
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:03,850
before. So this one for,

47
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:11,945
two? Very common question.

48
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:13,868
This is saying new one, right?

49
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:21,183
1.5

50
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:27,123
Welcome back Thank you.

51
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,129
Welcome back to

52
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,087
Okay, so this is how you update it and also when

53
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:57,116
when I sent you a new video, I'll show how to do it.

54
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:01,985
When I sent you a new video, you first go to the proper module,

55
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:05,652
then you click edit,

56
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:09,539
and then now you find the place where to put it.

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,744
And here you see video, here is nothing,

58
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,671
video. So if there is video,

59
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,457
we just replace the the word video with this. If there is nothing, we

60
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:20,781
put it directly under the caption,

61
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,745
under the the title. Okay,

62
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:27,531
so now let us use this one.

63
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:32,900
And the this is the

64
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:40,112
this is the link. So for the second module,

65
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:44,670
please finish it. Please do it for all the videos we uploaded.

66
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,427
And create a process document for that. So for LLM course,

67
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:52,051
it's like that. For other courses,

68
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:56,017
it's a little bit different, but also when we need,

69
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:58,453
I'll show you how to do that.

70
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:03,518
Okay, so this is how you update the links to the course

71
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:05,523
videos in the course repository.
