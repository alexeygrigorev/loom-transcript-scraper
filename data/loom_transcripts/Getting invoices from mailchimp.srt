1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,660
Yeah, there was an invoice from MailChimp.

2
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:05,420
I wanted to show you, um, how to,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:06,860
<v 1>Um,

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,910
Not invoice, but email. You probably saw it,

5
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:12,910
right. So I forwarded it to you. Um,

6
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:16,790
you should receive it. I also wanted to show you how to get these

7
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,390
invoices from, from MailChimp.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,030
So you go to MailChimp.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,070
I actually don't know if I already showed you this video or not.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,670
<v 1>Um,

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,750
In case I haven't, this is how you do it in case I did,

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:41,030
then you can just ignore it. So go to accountant billing and

13
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:43,710
here, uh, it seems I need to upgrade it,

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,050
but for now, uh, I wanted to show you building history

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,170
and it was today.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,930
It became cheaper actually. Yeah.

17
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:00,370
I think it became cheaper because, um, of taxes.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,610
Right. So now, uh, I don't pay some taxes that I used to pay,

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,490
which is very good news for me then,

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,770
uh, yeah. Click on the,

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,490
<v 1>And

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,030
yeah,

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,240
Indeed are not access really cool.

24
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:23,200
Yeah. I think because now taxi,

25
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:25,640
uh, it doesn't matter. Okay. So,

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,400
uh, right now what we do is just click print and then

27
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:35,000
we'll print it and then you send it to that

28
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,040
folder or to do that email.

29
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,080
Right. And then fill everything in, in the,

30
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,450
um, in the spreadsheet.

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,530
So that's one of the options or, uh, so because if I say here's

32
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:48,570
the email I got from MailChimp, um,

33
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,650
<v 1>Or

34
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,610
Something like this, uh, so then you can go here and then save the

35
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:58,650
invoice. Okay. Yeah. So this is how you save invoices from MailChimp.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,010
This is how you get invoices from MailChimp.
