Hi, maybe you remember that now for open-source spotlight we have a new calendar

2
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:07,940
link which looks like that.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,000
It's currently the DC Alexi OSSS.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,160
OSS, right? So this is the link.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,005
And right now in the calendar this is how it looks like.

6
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:24,385
You have access to my calendar so you should be able to see that.

7
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:30,685
So it says demo of this stack, open-source spotlight. And then it says who

8
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:35,405
is going to present? My country. In this case you can see their email

9
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:38,585
in my calendar just here,

10
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:41,742
right? So you can see it here and then you can copy it.

11
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:46,542
And then you can write them. Later on then you can also see GitHub

12
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:50,942
link and project name. So I ask them to fill this information when they

13
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:55,502
create a calendar event. So we already have this information in the

14
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:58,802
calendar. Right? And what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a

15
00:00:58,803 --> 00:01:01,737
calendar event. And what I'm going to do right now is just forward use

16
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:04,557
the link. So I will forward it to you.

17
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:08,797
And I also what I usually do is forward.

18
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:12,197
So this is not something you need to add in the process document.

19
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:17,217
So in the process document you'll probably show what to do after you receive

20
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:21,853
this email. This is just so it appears in

21
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:24,773
your to-do list. And so right now you will receive this email.

22
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,513
And you will know, okay,

23
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:33,253
that this is Andre. And then you see the

24
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:36,453
date, right? So you see when started and then you can just go to

25
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:38,894
my calendar and using the name.

26
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:45,654
Yeah, using the time I guess and then it's also so spot-by.

27
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,514
You can find this in my calendar.

28
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,674
And this is how you access email.

29
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:54,694
This is how you access project name and GitHub link.

30
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:59,330
And yeah, I don't need to. I just copy this information to you every

31
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,670
time. You know how to find it right now.

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,030
Okay, that's how you find information about open

33
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:10,630
source spotlights. Videos.

34
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,870
Yeah, that's it.
