00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:06,080
Hi. So just wanted to ask you about a few

2
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:08,320
things. So first, um,

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:12,680
so this clouds see there, for example, you edit them and yeah,

4
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:17,600
so this is the company, right? So because you were going through the conference,

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,000
usually when you click on a, a link,

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,680
so that, let me open it. So when you go through the conference and

7
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:27,960
then there is, uh, this Microsoft Azure for example,

8
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,360
right? So you click on this and then you have a link.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,080
So please, when you do this,

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,510
you let me, Microsoft Azure.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,050
So when you do this, get this link from here and

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,720
put it also here,

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,120
right? So then we have, um, the,

14
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:52,400
um, the website. I don't know why it's,

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,520
uh, Australian. Oh,

16
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,560
maybe it doesn't matter. Um,

17
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:59,160
yeah, so please, when you fill this in,

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,010
um, add the links and that

19
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:07,850
will help me than easier add text later so I can click on these

20
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:09,930
things and then, um,

21
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:12,250
see what kind of text I should add to these companies.
