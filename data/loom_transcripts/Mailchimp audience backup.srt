1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,850
Um, there is another thing I wanted to show you in MailChimp is

2
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:10,860
experts in audience to all the emails that

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:13,080
we have. So you need to, this is,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,630
first of all, I usually just start with MailChimp website and

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm already logged in. So usually when you log in,

6
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:26,590
you end up in this, okay.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,680
This dashboard, but then you go to audience.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,100
And so the audiences data docs,

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,740
you click on you contacts, and

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,350
then you click on experts, audience.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:49,350
So click on this and it starts expediting the audience and

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,260
yeah. Then you will receive an email.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,020
So I already just deepest,

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,280
<v 1>Um,

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,900
I click on this one, so you should receive an email.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,910
Do you think click on something.

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,840
<v 1>Oh, okay.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,840
I could take some time, um,

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,200
one minute or something like this and then,

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,100
uh, yeah, this expert, this radio. I can just click on this button,

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,280
I think. Yeah. And then he'd done lots of file.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,460
So we open this file and we put the name,

23
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:28,680
it would say 20, 22, 0 5 or 17.

24
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:33,120
What's the day to day 27 97.

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,060
Um, members export. Yeah, that's fine.

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,380
Oh, we'll kind of just leave it like this, just to,

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,980
so, and then,

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,060
um, then we upload this to Google drive,

29
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,470
so we'll just create a folder that Google use for this.

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,590
So create a folder that,

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,040
uh,

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,650
<v 1>Oh cool.

33
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,870
Least.

34
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,700
All right. So you're going to need to upload to this folder data,

35
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:22,320
top slot made in these backups and just take this thing and upload

36
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:26,340
it here. Now it should be applauded.

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,530
Okay. This is how you take a backup of the audience from MailChimp.

38
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,300
Um, yeah. And this is how you save it to Google drive.

39
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,400
That's all I wanted.
