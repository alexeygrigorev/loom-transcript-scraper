1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,170
Show you how to add extra information to book of the week pages.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,150
So I created, I created a page,

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,520
which for this book as one visual direction,

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,310
and I added this one so that the author give

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,260
to our community. So first they wanted to show you how I edit this.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,080
So for that, you need to go to book and

7
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:35,470
then there is a long case, two books, and then,

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,430
uh, you need to find the proper one.

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,490
Yeah. I'm by the way, on get half sweat beach or

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,220
upset, this is the location.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,130
Location is get hub accommodated and data docs pop up.

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,060
And then there, I selected the folder and physical books.

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,410
And then here, I need to find this visual introduction to the permit.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,520
And usually it will be one of the last books, right?

15
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,020
Because this will be the books that we have in the pipeline.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,190
And you can see the date here.

17
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:19,870
So this is the book of the week on 14 February and here,

18
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:24,610
okay. This date, after you find this book,

19
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,610
click on us, then click edit.

20
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,460
And so, and then there was some texts and this

21
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,230
thing wasn't here. So what I did is I added a few line breaks

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,140
and we did there and then click commit changes.

23
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,720
Okay, I won't do this because it's already done.

24
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,850
You just wanted to show you how I do this.

25
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,620
And then the other thing, all right now,

26
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,880
or sent me a sample. So he sent me a PDF file.

27
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,520
I cannot just include a PDF file easily.

28
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,120
So , so what I did

29
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,820
is I asked him,

30
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,580
can you please support this samples somewhere?

31
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:22,690
And then I will add this to then the one page  page as well.

32
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:25,960
I needed direct link. So I can just take this,

33
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,610
uh, PDF and, and this. So that's why I need a

34
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:38,830
direct link and your edit this link to

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,990
his Google drive. And now I want to add this

36
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,780
direct link that he created to the website,

37
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,490
to our page. So on that page,

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,040
we have please think this section talk links,

39
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,930
and there's a lot of the one link to the website.

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,160
Say, I want to add another one. And yeah,

41
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,860

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,300
So first it will be link. So business link,

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,650

So first minus indicating that this is a new item in new link,

46
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,970
and then this new item has two things there,

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,620
