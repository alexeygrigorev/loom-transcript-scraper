1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,990
Okay. So many people now have problems joining slug.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,110
That's why I could eat this form.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,090
They feel their email here, and we get data

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:16,590
here in, so let me show you how to get here.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,640
So when you log into it, they will give you see this.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,200
And then one of the things here is the scene right there.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,670
And this is the first thing,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,980
and these are the emails. So

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,260
Let me add, um,

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,070

11
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:50,280
just for us to remember who invited them,

12
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,090

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:08,140
