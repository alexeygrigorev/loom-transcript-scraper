1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,120
Um, that's another one. So here,

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:06,150
I want to send a calendar invite to a speaker.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,780
Um, she had to give a talk on a webinar.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,930
So now let me go to this timetable and TSI already featured

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,260
stores. So not yet confirmed,

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,630
uh, well, we kind of agreed on a date,

7
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,690
so I can probably say that it is confirmed.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,690
We can see like it eaten on a topic yet,

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,210
so she will send the title and the outline,

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,840
but yeah, we'll have the date and she'll also give me

11
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,860
your email. So now I want to send the calendar invite.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,530
So we talked about the 15th of March.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,860
Yeah. This one March.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,200
Yeah. Tuesday before

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,390
they weren't like, uh,

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,860
data or,

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,250
and then I guessed, so,

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,210
um, let me check more

19
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,220
options too, just to show you that. Yeah.

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,210
You can modify the ones. You don't have to click on more options.

21
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:35,920
I think by default, uh, depending on what your default settings

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,840
are, my default settings are include many firebrand might

23
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:45,880
not. So maybe click on this more options and here

24
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,850
I need to add, so since this is a webinar,

25
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,240
I don't need to add a podcast description.

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,430
So only need to only need to add content or just

27
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,640
take it once a year and just send it to you.

28
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,930
I think we have to include that here.

29
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:05,950
And also here

30
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,590
send yes.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,610
Nope. So this is how you send calendar invites.

32
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:25,200
You probably figured this out. Matthew just wanted to show you also that far

33
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,260
away in us, it's a little bit different and we can also send the

34
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:32,100
calendar invite even before we agreed on a specific topic,

35
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,380
but we're already agreed on a date. So just to block the calendar of

36
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:40,500
speaker, I sent this calendar invite.

37
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,330
So this is how I do it.
