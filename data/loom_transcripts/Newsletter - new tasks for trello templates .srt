1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,270
<v 1>Hi, I want to know for you to start working on newsletter

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,090
And thread. Now in thriller,

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:09,870
I

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,550
<v 1>Want to add a few points, so you know what them,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,060
And

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,310
can you

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:28,860
Smell

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,930
<v 1>We'll need to this link a doc,

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,380
I think we have a process document about that.

10
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,160
So this

11
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:42,540
Link it, You

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,910
<v 1>Think it's.

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,820
Yeah, so basically this happens before,

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,070
Before the newsletter goes out. So

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,580
I think every week, um, sometime during the week,

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,990
maybe, I don't know, on Wednesday or Thursday,

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,350
it will ask you to start preparing the newsletter.

18
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:15,910
And then one of the points here we'll be feeding in the newsletter

19
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:20,920
announcement. So this is for the book Then

20
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,670
for,

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,810
Um,

22
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:23,800
<v 1>And for,

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,190
Um, So let me show you

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,130
For

25
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:37,430
<v 1>That

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,860
Chimp. Yeah. Excellent.

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,120
<v 1>To have this podcast section this way in your podcast episode.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,650
So this is typically available when we have a podcast page.

29
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,680
So it's one of the items here

30
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,090
That last

31
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,910
Page.

32
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,890
<v 1>I think they have fun document about that as well.

33
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,320
Sorry.

34
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,700
<v 1>So this should happen before. Um,

35
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,560
So usually this happens, let's say on Friday we make the podcast

36
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:33,830
page or on Sunday and then on Sunday,

37
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,840
because we already have the template or the newsletter.

38
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,320
We can just go there and replace one of the things That

39
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,790
links there. Yeah.

40
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:52,430
I don't think we need to Do anything else here

41
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:57,200
at some at this point. So I just added one more thing here

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,650
in the book of the week. And one more thing to

43
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:07,000
the podcast. We'll now separate one for,

44
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,010
for the newsletter. Um,

45
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,190
so you know how to be ordered not,

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,810
but they just want to show you how you clone it and leave it

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,610
for like when we don't get this podcast episode.

48
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,380
Okay.
