1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,020
Yeah, I almost forgot to send the tax support.

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:06,690
So I wanted to show you how to do this. Uh,

3
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:09,120
so last time we prepare to,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,200
right, so now, um,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,440
I want to show you how to send it to my accountants.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,570
So not a leak. So this is a secure email and,

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,520
um, the Tiana

8
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:28,920
is, so this is your email.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,850
You don't need to remember here emails because I am made in UCC.

10
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:39,180
So you will see this. So you need to create an email

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,470
with this subject. So data talks about club then the month,

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,080
month, August, 2022.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,330
And then, uh, what you need to do is you go to the support,

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,640
you select this one. So from columns a to column F

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,200
alright, so these work, and then it includes here.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,380
Um, so we already prepared the

17
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,770
archive, so I will do the archive right now.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,920
So then just that, okay. Remember the button is data talks club last

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,010
year, minus month. So my touching.

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,570
Okay.

21
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,970
And I think that's all right.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,870
So, uh, they have a table and they have the zebra.

23
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,400
So yeah, I am sent to now.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,170
Yeah. So this is how we send reports.

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,190
You account for bookkeeping.
