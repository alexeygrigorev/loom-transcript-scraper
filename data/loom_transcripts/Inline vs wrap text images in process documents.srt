Yeah, hi, I was going through protest docs and then notice that most

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,430
of the images are in Rupt text mode.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,750
So please make them in line because when it's scrapped text mode,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,730
you see I'm trying to move the image and it's not moving.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,920
So the way to control this is just use this in line mode.

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,350
And then you see it's like, then it becomes a part of the text,

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,550
so you don't need to change anything or the existing ones.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,460
Um, but please for the new ones,

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,510
make it in line. Do not make it interrupt text.
