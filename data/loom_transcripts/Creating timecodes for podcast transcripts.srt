1
00:00:00,316 --> 00:00:02,333
Okay, so I played with the prompt a little bit,

2
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:07,262
uh so here the prompt I also uh

3
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:10,267
updated them, uh updated the file so when do you record, when you create,

4
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:14,222
uh sorry, when you create process documents,

5
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:18,831
make sure that you, uh take screenshots from this updated

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:21,797
one, um so here we have like their,

7
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:24,449
how to say, it's easy easier to spot them,

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,473
I guess, so prompt for correcting,

9
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:29,338
this is what we did before, prompt for titles,

10
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:35,481
this is what I created, right, so we copy the prompt

11
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:38,663
I put the prompt to chat.gpt and hit enter,

12
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:44,416
now it says yeah, okay, send it, and then I take the entire transcript

13
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:51,975
and send it to chatgpt, now uhm

14
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:56,563
yeah, so this is actually, we can already take

15
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:03,846
this and copy it copy this to to

16
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:08,840
youtube, right? we will just need to remove

17
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:12,628
the uh this line breaks,

18
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,337
right? um but okay so this is one thing

19
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:21,986
that's good we will uh but we already have

20
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:27,435
a flow for for creating timecodes which we can

21
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:31,443
reuse so we don't have to copy it here but we can if we

22
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:36,211
want so then uh

23
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:40,979
introduction and guest introduction okay yeah we can we can just do this like

24
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:45,552
it's kind of stupid but like i don't think it anyways

25
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:50,112
yeah let's not uh spend too much time checking

26
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:55,304
it so we see that for 147 this

27
00:01:55,305 --> 00:02:00,273
is the title right so what we do here add oops add

28
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:05,102
the title here if you want you can make a heading i

29
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:09,800
don't think think that our uhm like

30
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:13,447
the script that we use for transcribing actually cares whether there is title or

31
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:17,988
not okay so we added this so for me it will be simple simpler

32
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,988
if i just remove it right so then i it's clear to me what

33
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:29,306
i added what i did not so 229 we

34
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:34,146
have it here um right then

35
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:43,758
uh or 56 I

36
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,955
think here yeah let's use that

37
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:54,987
so 7.35

38
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:05,612
Okay, and so on. I think you've got the point,

39
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:07,092
like 9.03.

40
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:15,691
Okay, I think I need to tune the prompt, because like,

41
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,916
it's actually too granular,

42
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:22,983
too small, but you will see changes here in the prompt.

43
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:27,032
So I'll adjust the prompt, I'll try to ask it to speed to make

44
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:31,781
not so small sections, uh

45
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:35,428
yeah, I'll probably adjust that, because right now it's just too,

46
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,433
like, basically every exchange,

47
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:43,340
uh, it marks as uhm,

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,825
yeah, but that's not, that's not important for the video.

49
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:49,785
I think you get the point, right? So now, now you basically looked,

50
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:52,625
look at this, uh, point,

51
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,425
uh, let me do it for the next one, right?

52
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:58,885
So you look at this timestamp, 12.45,

53
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,994
you find it. You it here,

54
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:06,039
you take the thing,

55
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,604
put it here as a title,

56
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:13,675
and you do it for all, uhm for all the titles here,

57
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:17,983
and then you just download as Microsoft Word document,

58
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:23,212
and then you go through the same process as we did before with PAL,

59
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:26,731
okay? So this is how we can come up with titles,

60
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:30,337
I'll tweak the prompt a little bit,

61
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,584
but yeah, so every time you do it, there will be an updated prompt

62
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:39,090
here, so just take it from here, from uhm from this part,

63
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,394
cause I think I might be tweaking the prompt,

64
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:45,002
prompts. Okay, so that's it,

65
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:47,406
uhm let's use it.
