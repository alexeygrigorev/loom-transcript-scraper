1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,700
Oh, hi. I just noticed that the file,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,590
this picture that you submitted recently is quite large to max.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,830
And then if I open it, it's also open it

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,920
with a different editor.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,200
It's also quite large. So this is like,

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,510
um, I don't know,

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,750
100, um, basically it's just a huge,

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,350
um, I think what we should do is in general,

9
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:34,160
we should prefer smaller images.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,420
Everything like that, like 400 by 600 is enough.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,170
Um, we do not need a bigger one. So please,

12
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:46,220
next time when you upload an image and if you get as like a

13
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:49,550
large one resize it because we do not need to be key much.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,430
And then now I will save it saved on the,

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,850
see it's like instead of two, two gigs,

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,810
two megabytes, it's 84 kilobytes.

17
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,420
It's important because for the page,

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,120
but right now let's say if I open the website,

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,870
um, I'm gonna go to books,

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,860
like actually takes time to load this image.

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,070
So this is the same image and it, uh, it is to max it's

22
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:19,220
Barch. So now it will build faster.

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,940
So please, next time when you upload an image,

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,660
uh, please try to briefly size it tight to make it,

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,130
uh, not way to launch.
