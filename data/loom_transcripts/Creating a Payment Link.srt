00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,680
Hi, so here in this email Anna is asking for payment through

2
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:09,300
a payment link and I wanted to show you how to do this.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,940
So first you go to Fino and you create an invoice as usual but

4
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:18,340
in addition to what we typically do you add 2%.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,110
1,500 plus 2%.

6
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:30,590
So yeah, it's 30, 30 euros extra.

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,870
And then since Double Cloud is in Germany,

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,430
you will add VAT, but yeah,

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,390
that's, that's a part of the different process that you already know of.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,954
So this is the price that we will see. Send them in the invoice

11
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:48,654
that we create in Phenom. So this is like you create invoices as usual,

12
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:51,174
but then for the payment link,

13
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:55,294
we will actually need to go to Revolut,

14
00:00:56,554 --> 00:01:01,294
Revolut business. I think you should have access to

15
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,594
Revolut business if you do not let.

16
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:10,812
You know, it's

17
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:16,612
it was a while ago since I joined since I used it.

18
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:21,712
Okay. I'll put this on post to figure out how do I login.

19
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,692
Okay. So it was just not the right year.

20
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:30,179
The right URL is the revolute.com slash business and then enter

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,899
the extra business account and then login. And I

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,899
am just continuing with my email.

23
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,759
I think you should have your own account. Okay.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,859
I'll confirm it now.

25
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,699
Okay. I can turn the login from my app.

26
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:52,094
And here I

27
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:56,934
think we need to go to merchant and create a request

28
00:01:56,935 --> 00:01:59,334
payment link.

29
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:02,794
And with the payment link,

30
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:06,494
we put.

31
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:13,108
So it, it will be this one plus 19% because

32
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:17,768
it's in Germany. It's VAT,

33
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:23,008
but yeah, it will be different for different entities.

34
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,628
So since these ones are in Germany, this is the price.

35
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:33,939
I'll

36
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:52,040
try. Integration,

37
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,080
integration, and then it's next week,

38
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,380
right?

39
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,700
Something like that. So this is what you will need to create.

40
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:14,123
Yeah. So this is the payment link.

41
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:19,323
We click create and this is the link we

42
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:24,523
sent. So I will send this link to you right now and

43
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:29,123
you will create an invoice to double

44
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:35,078
data. So you will ask, you will need to ask them for or I

45
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,598
can know all this like

46
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,718
company details and so on.

47
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,938
Right. And yeah.

48
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:50,238
So once you have them, you send them the invoice from Phenom and then

49
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,381
you send them this payment link. Right.

50
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:57,161
I will send you the link right now in Slack or in sorry,

51
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:00,301
in Telegram. So you have it, then you will send it and now you

52
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:03,581
will create a document, describing how to create payment links.

53
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,141
And yeah. Okay.

54
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:12,321
And I think let me quickly check if when we create invoices,

55
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,921
we can actually add some comments.

56
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:23,808
Yeah. So let's add this to terms payment link.

57
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:27,768
So yeah, we will add this to the payment link, to the terms and

58
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:31,128
notes. Okay.

59
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,768
So this is how we do this. Please create a.

60
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,579
Process document and please send it to Anna.

61
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:38,219
That's it.
