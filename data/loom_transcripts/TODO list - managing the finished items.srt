1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,300
Um, pain. So regarding the to-do list.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,430
So you, so for this is things

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:11,280
that are done, so you keep them,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,570
and it was something like this,

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,370
right. And this turned out to be a bit confusion

6
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:24,750
for the script. So it started inserting these things here.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,790
So what I want to ask you next time.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,620
So they, if you want to hide them to first move them

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,370
like this, so just like drag and drop.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,130
So you just put them here,

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,170
like for this great thing and step up and

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,700
then, alright. And then now everything

13
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,890
that is done already, uh,

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,140
on top, so all of them are together and then

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,750
everything that is not done is here.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,760
Yeah. So I think it's, um, this way it's easier and then it's not

17
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:11,340
confusing for the script. So the scape always here

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,890
at the end. So it was tying it to the middle.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,980
Let me see. It was trying to write something to the middle.

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,720
Um, yeah. So better to like put things that

21
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:27,900
I've done. Um, so for example,

22
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:32,490
you've finished this one, just knock them up and then write

23
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:32,640
them.
