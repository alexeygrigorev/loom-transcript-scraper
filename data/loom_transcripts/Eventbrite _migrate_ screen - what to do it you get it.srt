00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,060
If you ever have a station like this,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,600
so I just want to show you what to do. So it wasn't events.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,010
So a few things, some information, um,

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,860
about the event. And then I click save.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,410
Uh, I cannot show you that, unfortunately,

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,310
and then it shows me that you hated this event.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,910
So what I do is I just click and get started.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:25,860
Then I click

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,350
when this thing floats and then I click save number eight,

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,510
probably continues right now.

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,560
Yeah. And then I just say,

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,950
no, I don't know why it's doing this.

13
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:50,800
Sometimes it's sometimes it's doing that sometimes it's not,

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,340
but in case you have this problem,

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,770
um, yeah, this is what you do. Just click on button set till you

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,060
get to this clean again. So what happened is,

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,120
uh, what was it?

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,830
So it wasn't details here. I was editing this thing and then I click

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,640
save and then that's screen up here.

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,810
So yeah, if you have something like this,

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,040
this is what you do.
