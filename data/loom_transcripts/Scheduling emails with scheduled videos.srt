1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,960
I think it's a good idea. We,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,360
so when I ask you, please schedule something for tomorrow for

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:12,330
open source spotlights specifically. Um,

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,360
so when you do this, you on August kiddo,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,500
and this is actually

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,640
<v 1>Have

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,010
This thing here, usually what's the next thing we

8
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,920
do. Uh, whereas the travel board,

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,990
Our Trello board opensource, we ask the guests to

10
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,750
share the email, uh, the event with

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,000
Recording with their network.

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,450
So, um, here, because usually 5:00 PM

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,610
central European time, you're usually sleeping during this time and

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,260
I'd like them to receive the email immediately after it is

15
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,740
published. So what we can do here is,

16
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:15,480
uh, schedule And

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,270
email. Um,

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,520
the link I think are,

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,090
I think, yes. Yeah.

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,760
Maybe we don't do this as a separate meeting,

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,450
uh, a separate item,

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,660
but this one, Um,

23
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,370
Hmm.

24
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,450
Yeah. So here we'll have a template. So the way you can do this,

25
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,300
so you write it, have a mold,

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,790
send it, this is just an example. So you would apply it and

27
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,780
then you sent schedule sound like,

28
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:15,400
of course you need to The link

29
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,400
and then you in everything,

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,820
And then you just do a schedule. And if I ask you to schedule

31
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:33,670
it for tomorrow, select the date and time.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,440
So for example, tomorrow,

33
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,110
Yeah, you'll probably need to do translation translation.

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,150
Um, but yeah, let's say if you or eat for 17 or

35
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:52,680
5:00 PM, then you can scale all the email email or 17 0 5.

36
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,290
So then you just schedule sound, and then they will get the email immediately

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,020
after the recording costs life. So they,

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,810
if they receive it, they can already share it with pain network because

39
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:16,430
it's hugely helpful for YouTube when at

40
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:20,960
the beginning, right. Immediately after it gets more views.

41
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,020
So if they share after we publish,

42
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,270
it's actually with her, by the way,

43
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,170
and notice that,

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,720
uh, like after,

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,000
if you have a colon, there should be no space.

46
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,300
Please pay attention to the patient.

47
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,970
Yeah. So this is how you can schedule emails,

48
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,170
um, about open source spotlight after scheduling the

49
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,980
YouTube link.

50
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,680
Now you can also add where you can create a process doc

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,120
and edit here. So I'll have this doc

52
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,350
and then we already have a template. And then in this document,

53
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,070
please link the template as well. Okay.
