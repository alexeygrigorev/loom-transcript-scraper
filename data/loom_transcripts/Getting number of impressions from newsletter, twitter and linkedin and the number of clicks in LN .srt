1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,410
Yeah. Found it. So this is, let me show you how to get there.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,870
Still. We go to their organization club and

3
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:14,690
then here, this

4
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:17,370
is for one month, the last 30 days,

5
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,340
I guess, because it's relatively new.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,440
Right? And then we have this, uh, upgrades and then one of these candidates

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,440
is this one open source,

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,320
blah, blah, blah. And then one of the things here is

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,210
this one number of kicks.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,790
Yeah. This is number of clicks. So we'll have 33 clicks.

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,460
Um, I think what is also interesting maybe is the number of impressions.

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,500
So let me open Twitter again.

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,360
I'll show you how to find it so we can

14
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:04,200
keep them like a,

15
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,850
so this one had 2000 impressions.

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,100
So

17
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,700
use the compression view and the same thing.

18
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,210
So then LinkedIn will have number of impressions

19
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,140
and then just put there

20
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,670
that's the open rate, basically complaints

21
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,690
now, but you already know how to, you see how many people opened it.

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:07,980
<v 1>Okay.

23
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,150
And then now we can just sound this up.

24
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,210
Oops. This one,

25
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,550
this one. So

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,970
this would be the total number of impressions.

27
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,360
And let me see.

28
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,300
So I'll do the same exercise now with clicks plus

29
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,940
11 plus 33.

30
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,540
Yeah. So we can follow this format where we share the performance.

31
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,610
So number of views, number of clicks. Yeah.

32
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,250
Let me, because I think this is a little bit to,

33
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,470
because it's a high number and clicks is a lot less somebody misleading

34
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,940
again. That's all I want.
