00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,020
Um, yeah. Hi. I noticed that we have this section here,

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,630
so here for this articles, we put only new articles.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,520
So because this week we didn't have any new articles as far as I

4
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,740
remember. Right. Um, maybe we did,

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,380
but I think we did not. So yeah,

6
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:26,430
we don't need to add new articles because this is something I think we've

7
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:29,160
had in the previous one. So let me quickly check it.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,070
So it's MailChimp 84 and

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,700
we already had all this article here,

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,060
so yeah, we don't need to pick up the same articles again

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,100
and yeah.

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,020
So I'm just delete them. So we add this slide

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,150
with articles. So if there are new articles,

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,460
if there are no, just delete them.
