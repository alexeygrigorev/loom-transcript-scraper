1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,030
Oh, hi. Yeah. I wanted to show you how to bond people.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,570
So first of all, um, I prepared this message.

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,880
I will send it to you. So you have like a copy.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,550
And then I go to settings sending me station

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,600
manage members. So you are also an admin,

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,000
so you should have it. And then this is the user.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,560
Want to Goodman will now

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,000
find your month.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,290
And, uh, yeah, so this is how we bond is like just

10
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,080
click here and deactivate the account.

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,560
So of course we need to make sure that this is the person who

12
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:47,370
want to bond. So we need also to check that like the name and

13
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:51,690
then the pictogram, this is a person because there is only one that of

14
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:54,180
Goodman. So we activate the account.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,770
So that's all. And now I will send to you this message.

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,120
And this is how we want people.
