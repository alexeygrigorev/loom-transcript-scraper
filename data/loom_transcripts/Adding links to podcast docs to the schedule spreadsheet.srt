00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,100
Um, Hey, I just want to make it easier to find documents.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,670
So here in this schedule document,

3
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:12,900
we can add a link. So just click on this insert link or,

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,020
And then I think it doing suggests to find it,

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:22,470
but if it doesn't then you know where to find them,

6
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:22,620
right.

7
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:39,310
And then we have these things here. So it suggests to Use

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,890
this link. So we'll just apply This

9
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:47,680
way. We'll have links for that's pretty convenient.

10
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,810
Sure. Actually,

11
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,260
I wanted to ask you to feel the same for everyone,

12
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,260
but it seems to be so easy that it's just faster for me to

13
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,440
do this. Just press control key, and then for others,

14
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,920
it doesn't. Yeah.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,230
So this way it's simpler to,

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,360
To do this and they wanted to ask you to add,

17
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,230
this is another step in the some process document,

18
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,150
Um, that we need to, once we create this document,

19
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,050
uh, this podcast document, we also link it in the data.

20
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:34,980
Docs stops Cato.
