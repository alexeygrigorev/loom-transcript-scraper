1
00:00:02,237 --> 00:00:07,027
So, we have a problem that for Tanya it's just a name and

2
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:11,533
it will appear like that. Usually this happens when we don't have

3
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:16,624
a profile. And I think I showed you last time.

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,062
We have this link, slash people,

5
00:00:19,063 --> 00:00:22,036
Tanya. Let's check.

6
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:27,673
Yeah, so you see, actually, if we look at the the URL here,

7
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:29,685
it's Tanya Wald.

8
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:32,933
Like there is a first a typo and then not here.

9
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:36,688
Full name, right? That's why it doesn't match.

10
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:51,681
And here it's just Tanya Vuh-Volt,

11
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:55,576
right? So this is not right. And we need to make sure that this

12
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:58,470
thing and this thing match.

13
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:02,235
And if we go to, uh,

14
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:04,377
first let's open the events.

15
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:07,021
I want to show you what I meant.

16
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:12,748
So here, so this is the ID for people that we have,

17
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:15,662
right? Um, so the room,

18
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:21,030
we, it's so slow like we have so many events.

19
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,162
And we have, uh, Teresa,

20
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:26,537
uh, I think should be here,

21
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:29,020
Tanya Berger, right?

22
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:34,117
So, uh, here we have this one,

23
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:37,345
but as you saw in people, we have a different name.

24
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:40,128
So to fix it, we need to go to people,

25
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:43,964
and we need to make sure that, uhm,

26
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,677
the name we have here, Tanya,

27
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:50,192
matches the name we have, uhm,

28
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,428
in the event. So in this particular case, uhm, this,

29
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:55,552
or what we need is just to rename this,

30
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:58,215
but we might also, uh,

31
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:00,969
create another file. Let's say if we don't,

32
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,363
if we don't have a profile yet, and then this problem appears,

33
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:06,515
then the reason is we don't have the profile.

34
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:09,303
So in this case, we just need to edit the file.

35
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:11,686
So this is how we change the name,

36
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:16,753
so this is where we update it, and you just can make changes,

37
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,833
and that's it. So right now, this should match, and, uh,

38
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,900
yeah, and also,

39
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:30,636
uh, wait a second, so this thing and this thing short should

40
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:34,772
match too, so it should be identical,

41
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:39,508
this one and this one, because I think it

42
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,069
doesn't look at the short,

43
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,904
and also I see already the image is not correct,

44
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:48,757
so I will also change the name for the image,

45
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:52,822
and now we will also need to go to this images slash authors,

46
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:57,153
and update it there. to,

47
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:06,355
so go to images authors,

48
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:09,980
so if you, if we need to add a person,

49
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,262
then we just follow, we just use the form, right, so you don't need

50
00:03:12,263 --> 00:03:17,090
to create a these files, so this thing is only for updating

51
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:19,963
the, the these profiles,

52
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:23,548
so this is how we should call the process document I guess,

53
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:26,742
so now let me look for Tanya,

54
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:31,363
and again we need to rename this to,

55
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:36,363
okay,

56
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:42,578
so now you know if you accidentally make a typo or use

57
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,154
incorrect name or whatever for all the whatever reason,

58
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:49,550
we cannot match the profile,

59
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:51,823
so this is what you need to look for.

60
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:56,949
So the file names should be the same as here and the short,

61
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,513
this id in the file should also match.

62
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:06,428
And right now I think it shouldn't work anymore when

63
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:11,114
we update, so it will probably take some time but um like

64
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:13,768
in a couple of minutes it should work.

65
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:15,162
Yep, so this is how we do.
