1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,980
Okay. Just wanted to show you the difference between workshops and seminars,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,430
some workshops, concerts. Um,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,400
I think the difference here is not between workshops and webinars,

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,650
but an event we sponsor.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,810
There is an extract that I usually once

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,030
don't have. So, um,

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm in, um, Eventbrite event right now.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,500
And if I go to options and order form,

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,930
Since there are some custom fields with some custom things that we add to

10
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:39,520
the forum, when people sign up for the event and usually the

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,280
think we'll have is do you want to subscribe to data talks,

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,770
newsletter and receive updates about new treatments?

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,620
So these are lands, have this Bent,

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,930
um, sponsored ones.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,480
They have Options and torture for Sponsors.

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,180
So This other thing,

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,330
what do you like to share your email with ThoughtSpot? Our sponsor?

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,920
The thing is that a, this event is not sponsored,

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,220
but since you quoted from the sponsor from the workshop,

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,730
Yeah, it hasn't been, so that's why we need to remove it and

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,950
Yeah, no, it's gone. Um,

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,990
so this one is on data monitoring with biologics piece

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,350
Cert. So that's why we're here.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,000
And we think we'll be there. This is something I

25
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,490
didn't mention to you. This one,

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,240
I, the machine learning pipelines with Kendra is not sponsored.

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,270
So this is a workshop it from a workshop.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,600
So this is fine. And just to mention,

29
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:54,810
you

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,890
Need to go on to actually from the workshop, but we check the duration.

31
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,020
Yeah. What's it been going on to order options?

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,540
Yeah. We still have this, then this thing here,

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,990
would you like to share your email with us? So we don't need that

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,420
Because this is not as possible. Um,

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,320
<v 1>This,

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,380
Okay, so this one is sponsored and the ones

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,150
This.

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,050
So let me make it clear for you, which one is sponsored.

39
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,150
So this one sponsor,

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,630
<v 1>Um,

41
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,140
This one is sponsored

42
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,660
<v 1>And

43
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,620
This one is sponsored. So now you will know that,

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,760
um, usually these workshops are sponsored.

45
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:58,160
So now you will know that these things,

46
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,270
you need to go on it. Other, another sponsored event,

47
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,970
which is duplicated workshop. Um,

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,450
next time, when they asked you to schedule a sponsored event,

49
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:15,010
I will make sure that I mentioned that the

50
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:15,430
sponsor.
