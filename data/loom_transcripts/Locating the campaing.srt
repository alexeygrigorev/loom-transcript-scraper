1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,790
Oh, by the way, just occurred to me that the easiest way to find

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,930
out when, um, should it, the complaint was sent the one that we are

3
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:09,060
interested. So for this one, uh,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,000
it's nanny. And so we go to our

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,360
docs and

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,820
we can this column here,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,750
newsletter sponsorship. Right. We see that Amani was,

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
um, here, um,

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,610
uh, 9th of May. So this is how we can easily locate it and know

10
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:38,190
which complaint we need to check. Okay.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,000
That's all the.
