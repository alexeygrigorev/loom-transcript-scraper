1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,570
I realize she's also asking for other things,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,340
um, these Daniel's test may be,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,740
uh, you can see them here,

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,280
like the swamp is,

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,970
so, yeah, well, just for that, um,

6
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,660
so you see like this, this complaint on 9th of May,

7
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,840
this was actually when we sent, uh, think about nanny.

8
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,450
Um, let me just quickly check that or,

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,330
yeah, that was a response. So she is asking what's on this

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,820
focus campaign,

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:54,960
<v 1>Gosh,

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,850
On this campaign, uh, how many open,

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,120
what was the open rate and click rate? So you can say that a

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,780
nine thousand nine thousand six hundred people.

15
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:09,450
So it also open rate was 30%.

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,740
And then this is how many clicks and the click rate was 2%.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,310
And then you can also show the numbers for,

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,530
for, for their, uh,

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,590
for their links and their links of asset. Uh,

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,180
this one and this one, I don't think we have other

21
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,450
links. Okay.

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,020
Yeah. That's uh, that's it. So for this complainant,

23
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,440
uh,
