00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,170
I am in process with arranging a book of the week,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,280
a event with one of the authors.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,190
So let me take this one.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,420
So there are actually many of them that they have in parallel.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,720
I will ask you to take care of the next,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,960
but for this one. So what I'll do. Yeah,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,120

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,250

00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,030
Um, they publish books. Um,

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,000
so she introduces me.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,800
She puts me in contact with Roy. Who's an author of this hands on

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,690
data processing and Python, and Roy already agreed

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,880
that, uh, he is quite interested,

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,400
um, to do this. So we want now to actually agree

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,980
or to, to, to help them.

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,140
So for that, I will not reply to all of them.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,570

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,420
