1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,880
Hi, I wanted to show you alter.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,940
We have in the shared folder and workshops.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,300
So what we have here is a description of workshops,

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,190
and then there is a template. So this is a template to use for

5
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,450
creating workshops. And workshop is something that is similar to webinars,

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,240
except it's more, hands-on waiting only

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,670
one of them to, or channel.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,350
There has been only one.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,100
Yeah, because it just one, but we'll plan to have more of them.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,040
They're very similar to webinars and the flow.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
If I open the board,

12
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:50,030
I think the floor is mostly

13
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:53,060
the same. So I don't think we need to create like a server separate

14
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,790
template, but maybe the will we will,

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,350
but what these webinars do not have,

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,470
the workshops is this template maybe actually will

17
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,360
need to create a similar template for webinars as well.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,440
So I think it's useful.

19
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,780
Yeah. So this is a description of a workshop,

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,610
so it will have title subtitle and date time and so on.

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,970
So for the description for, for the workshop,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,010
usually it's, uh, maybe longer than the workshop and

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,260
yeah, there is, this is something that we will send to the

24
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:36,170
instructors, what the workshop to feel in.

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,930
And now I ordered the one, so there will be a workshop with soda.

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,000
So actually it will be 26th of April and then yeah.

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,820
Working title sort of core, but who'll be something different and

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,400
this is something I want to send to them right now.

29
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,730
And then, um, ask them to appeal the scene.

30
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,140
We will kill this together. And then based on that,

31
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,780
we will later create, maybe it's actually a good idea to do

32
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:12,680
something like this for events, or maybe it's a bit cumbersome.

33
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,390
I don't know. But for workshops may want to try

34
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,750
this for workshops and see how it goes, and then maybe we can do

35
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:23,090
something similar for webinars as well.

36
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,590
Okay. So in summary, um,

37
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,210
before that it's workshops, we have a template here and I

38
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,850
just click on this one, make a copy.

39
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,050
Then like in the same way as we do with podcast,

40
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,410
um, I click on this,

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,030
uh, uh, the copy, modify the title and,

42
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,670
um, send it to, uh,

43
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,970
to the speaker, to being stuck with this book. I will do it right

44
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,460
now. Actually. I need to create another one.

45
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,420
So let me

46
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,090
<v 1>Your,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,040
yeah. So template template here

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,010
for March. Let me check,

49
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,070
uh, time is correct.

50
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,580
May 17th. So

51
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,040
let me just

52
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,920
name and company.

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,680
And now I will send these two documents,

54
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,170
uh, based on this,

55
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:09,300
because we plan to do, do you live in ours with them?

56
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,880
So we'll send, um,

57
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,910
I'll send links to,

58
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,410
um, these companies for that. And so we'll take it from there.

59
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,330
So yeah, these are the templates for webinars for work.
