00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,600
Hi. Yeah, we had a problem. So you see for the event tomorrow,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,480
it was not possible to buy, to not to buy,

3
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:12,840
to register, uh, for the webinar it was showing sales ended.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,880
And the reason for that is when you go to the event,

5
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:20,400
So let me show you from the start. So you go to my events,

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,080
uh, event bright events, come on.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,720
So then we have a bunch of events here,

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,360
and that was, um, the one tomorrow.

9
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:34,000
And then here the status was, um,

10
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:38,600
sale ended. So I needed to come here and

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,080
go to tickets. And then there is only one type of ticket,

12
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,080
which is, um,

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,960
this one. Alright, click on this.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,930
And I needed to change sales and so,

15
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,570
and then put some, So it was for, um,

16
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,650
yesterday or yesterday? It was,

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,810
yeah, I think it was yesterday. 6:00 PM for some reasons.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,770
So this is something we have to check every time.

19
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:11,090
So every time you publish an event, go here to tickets and check that

20
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:13,890
sales end is after the start date.

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,530
So in this case, there was, I don't know, a glitch or something.

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,850
So this, um, had a wrong end date.

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,290
We have to be careful and every time we create an event,

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,330
we have to go to tickets and check that the sales end is

25
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:34,170
after the, the actual lifetime.

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,890
So yeah, I save it. So now everything is fine.

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,810
Please update the, please update the process

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,410
document so it's there. And we,

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,690
uh, don't let this happen in the future.

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,890
Yeah, that's it.
